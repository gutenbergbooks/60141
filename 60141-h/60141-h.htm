<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>(FOR THE YOUNG FOLKS.)</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a young woman so kind and sweet-tempered
that every person loved her. Among the
rest, there was an old witch who lived near where
she dwelt, and with whom she was a great favorite.
One day this old witch told her she had a nice present
to give her. “See,” she said, “here is a barley-corn,
which, however, is by no means of the same
sort as those which grow in the farmer’s field, or
those we give to the fowls. Now you must plant
this in a flower-pot, and then take care and see what
happens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you a thousand times,” said the young
woman. And, thereupon, she went straight home,
and planted the barley-corn the witch had given her
in a flower-pot. Immediately there grew out of it a
large, handsome flower, but its leaves were all shut
close as if they were buds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a most beautiful flower!” said the woman,
while she bent down to kiss its red and yellow
leaves; but scarcely had her lips pressed the flower,
than it gave forth a loud sound and opened its cup.
And now the woman was able to see that it was a
regular tulip, and in the midst of the cup, down at
the bottom, there sat a small and most lovely little
maiden; her height was about one inch, and on that
account the woman named her Ellise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made the little thing a cradle out of a walnut-shell,
gave her a blue violet-leaf for a mattress, and
a rose-leaf for a coverlet. In this cradle Ellise slept
at night time, and during the day she played upon
the table. The woman had set a plate filled with
water upon the table, which she surrounded with
flowers, and the flower-stalks all rested on the edge
of the water; on the water floated a large tulip-leaf,
and upon the tulip-leaf sat the little Ellise, and sailed
from one side of the plate to the other; and for this
she used two white horse-hairs for oars. The whole
effect was very charming, and Ellise could sing too,
but with such a delicate little voice as we have never
heard here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night as she lay in her bed, an ugly toad hopped
into her through the broken window pane. It
was a large and very hideous toad; and it sprang at
once upon the table, where Ellise lay asleep under
the rose-leaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be, now, a nice little wife for my
son,” said the toad, and seized, as she said it, the
walnut-shell in her mouth, and hopped with it out
through the window into the garden again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the garden flowed a broad stream, but
its banks were marshy, and among the marshes
lived the toad and her son. Ha! how hideous the
son was too; exactly like his mother he was, and all
that he could say, when he saw the sweet little
maiden in the walnut-shell, was “Koax! koax!
breckke ke!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk so loud,” said the old one to him,
“else you’ll awake her, and then she might easily
run away from us, for she is lighter than swans’-down.
We will set her upon a large plant in the
stream; that will be a whole island for her, and then
she cannot run away from us; while we, down in
the mud, will build the house for you two to live
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the stream there were many large plants, which
all seemed as if they floated on the water; the most
distant one was, at the same time, the largest, and
thither swam the old toad and set down the walnut-shell,
with the little maiden upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early on the following morning the little Ellise
awoke, and when she looked about her and saw
where she was, that her new dwelling-place was
surrounded on all sides by water, and that there remained
no possible way for her to reach land again,
she began to weep most bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the old toad sat in the mud and adorned
the building with reeds and yellow flowers, that it
might be quite grand for her future daughter-in-law,
and then, in company with her hideous son, swam
to the little leaf-island where Ellise lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She now wanted to fetch her pretty little bed,
that it might at once be placed in the new chamber,
before Ellise herself was brought there. The
old toad bent herself courteously before her in the
water, while she presented her son in these words—“You
see here my son, who is to be your husband,
and you two shall live together charmingly down in
the mud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Koax! koax! breckke-ke!” was all that the
bridegroom could find to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, therewith, they both seized upon the beautiful
little bed, and swam away with it; while Ellise
sat alone upon the leaf and cried very much, for she
did not like at all to live with the frightful toad, much
less have her odious son for her husband. Now the
little fishes which swam about under the water, had
seen the toad, and heard, moreover, perfectly well
all that she said; they, therefore, raised their heads
above water, that they might have a look at the beautiful
little creature. No sooner had they seen her
than they were, one and all, quite moved by her
beauty; and it seemed to them very hard that such a
sweet maiden should become the prey of an ugly
toad. They assembled themselves, therefore, round
about the green stalk from which grew the leaf
whereon Ellise sat, and gnawed it with their teeth
until it came in two, and then away floated Ellise
and the leaf far, far away, where the toad could come
no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so sailed the little maiden by towns and villages,
and when the birds upon the trees beheld her,
they sang out—“Oh, what a lovely young girl.”
But away, away floated the leaf always further
and further. Ellise made quite a foreign journey
upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time a small white butterfly had hovered
over her, and at last he sat himself down on her leaf,
because he was very much pleased with Ellise, and
she, too, was very glad of the visit, for now the toad
could not come near her, and the country through
which she traveled was so beautiful. The sun
shone so bright upon the water that it glittered like
gold. And now the idea occurred to her to loosen
her girdle, bind one end of it to the butterfly, the
other on to the leaf; she did this and then she flew
on much faster, and saw much more of the world
than she would have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, at last, there came by a cock-chafer, who
seized her with his long claws round her slender
waist, and flew away with her to a tree, while on
swam the leaf, and the butterfly was obliged to follow,
for he could not come loose, so fast and firm
had Ellise bound him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! how terrified was poor Ellise when the cock-chafer
carried her off to the tree. But her sorrow
over the little butterfly was quite as great, for she
knew he must certainly perish, unless by some good
accident he should chance to free himself from the
green leaf. But all this made no impression upon
the cock-chafer, who set her upon a large leaf, gave
her some honey to eat, and told her she was very
charming, although not a bit like a chafer. And now
appeared all the other cock-chafers who dwelt upon
this tree, who waited upon Ellise, and examined her
from top to toe; while the young lady-chafers turned
up their feelers and said, “She has only two legs!
how very wretched that looks!” and added they,
“she has no feelers whatever, and is as thin in the
body as a human being! Ah! it’s really hideous!”
and all the young lady-cock-chafers cried out, “Ah!
it’s perfectly hideous!” And yet Ellise was so
charming! and so felt the cock-chafer; but at last,
because all the lady-chafers thought her ugly he began
to think so too, and resolved he would have
nothing more to do with her; “she might go,” he
said, “wherever she liked;” and with these words
he flew with her to the ground, and set her upon a
daisy. And now the poor little thing wept bitterly,
to find herself so hideous that not even a cock-chafer
would have any thing to do with her. But, notwithstanding
this decisive opinion of the young lady-cock-chafers,
Ellise was the loveliest, most elegant little
creature in the world, as delicate and beautiful as a
young rose-leaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole summer through the poor little maiden
lived alone in the great forest; and she wove herself
a bed out of fine grass, and hung it up to rock beneath
a creeper, that it might not be blown away by
the wind and rain; she plucked herself sweets out
of the flowers, for food, and drank of the fresh dew,
that fell every morning upon the grass. And so the
summer and the autumn passed away. All the birds
which had sung so sweetly to Ellise, left her and
went away, the trees lost all their green, the flowers
withered, and the great creeper which, until now,
had been her shelter, shriveled away to a bare yellow
stalk. The poor little thing shivered with cold,
for her clothes were now worn out, and her form was
so tender and delicate that she certainly would
perish with cold. It began also to snow, and every
flake which touched her, was to her what a great
heapfull would be to us, for her whole body was only
one inch long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close beside the forest in which Ellise lay, there
was a corn-field, but the corn had long since been
reaped, and now, only the dry stubble rose above the
earth; yet, for Ellise was this a great forest, and
hither she came. So she reached the house of a field-mouse,
which was formed of a little hole under the
stubble. Here dwelt the field-mouse warm and comfortable,
with her store-room full of food for the
winter, and near at hand a pretty kitchen and eating-room.
Poor Ellise stepped up to the door and begged
for a little grain of barley, for she had tasted
nothing for the whole day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor little wretch!” said the field-mouse,
who was very kind-hearted, “come in to my warm
room and eat something.” And when now she was
much pleased with Ellise, she added, “you may if
you like, spend the winter here with me; but you
must keep my house clean and neat, and tell me
stories, for I am very fond of hearing stories.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellise did as the field-mouse wished, and, as a
reward for her trouble, was made comfortable with
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we shall have a visit,” said the field-mouse
to her one day. “My neighbor is accustomed to pay
me a visit every week. He is much richer than I
am, for he has several beautiful rooms, and wears the
most costly velvet coat. Now if you could only have
him for your husband, you would be nicely provided
for, but he does not see very sharply, that’s one thing.
Only you must tell him all the best stories you can
think of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ellise would hear nothing of it, for she could
not endure the neighbor, for he was nothing more
nor less than a mole. He came, as was expected, to
pay his respects to the field-mouse, and wore his
handsome velvet coat as usual. The field-mouse
said he was very rich, and very well informed, and
that his house was twenty times larger than hers.
Well informed he might be, but he could not endure
the sunshine or the flowers, and spoke contemptuously
of both one and the other, although he had never
seen either. Ellise was obliged to sing before him,
and she sang the two songs—“Chafers fly! the sun
is shining!” and “The priest goes to the field!”
Then the mole became very much in love with her
because of her beautiful voice, but he took good
care not to show it, for he was a cautious, sensible
fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very lately he had made a long passage from his
dwelling to that of his neighbor, and he gave permission
to Ellise and the field-mouse to go in it as
often as they pleased; yet he begged of them not to
be startled at the dead bird which lay at the entrance.
It was certainly a bird lately dead, for all the feathers
were still upon him, it seemed to have been frozen
exactly there <a id='where'></a>where the mole had made the entrance
of his passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Neighbor now took a piece of tinder in his
mouth, and stepped on before the ladies, that he
might lighten the way for them, and as he came to
the place where the dead bird lay, he struck with his
snout on the ground, so that the earth rolled away,
and a large opening appeared through which the daylight
shone in. And now, Ellise could see the dead
bird quite well—it was a swallow. The pretty
wings were pressed against the body, and the feet
and head covered over by the feathers. “The poor
bird has died of cold,” said Ellise, and it grieved her
very much for the dear little animal, for she was
very fond of birds, for they sang to her all through
the summer. But the mole kicked him with his
foot and said, “The fine fellow has done with his
twittering now! It must indeed be dreadful to be
born a bird! Heaven be praised that none of my
children have turned out birds! Stupid things! they
have nothing in the wide world but their quivit, and
when the winter comes, die they must!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” returned the field-mouse, “you, a thoughtful
and reflecting man, may well say that! What
indeed has a bird beyond its twitter when the winter
comes? he must perforce hunger and freeze!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellise was silent; but when the others had turned
their backs upon the bird, she raised up its feathers
gently, and kissed its closed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it was you,” she said softly, “who sang
me such beautiful songs! How often you have made
me happy and merry, you dear bird!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the mole stopped up the opening again
through which the daylight fell, and then accompanied
the young ladies home. But Ellise could not
sleep the whole night long. She got up, therefore,
wove a covering of hay, carried it away to the dead
bird, and covered him with it on all sides, in order
that he might rest warmer upon the cold ground.
“Farewell, you sweet, pretty little bird!” said she.
“Farewell! and let me thank you a thousand times
for your friendly song this summer, when the trees
were all green, and the sun shone down so warm
upon us all!” And therewith she laid her little
head on the bird’s breast, but started back, for it
seemed to her as if something moved within. It was
the bird’s heart; he was not dead, but benumbed,
and now he came again to life as the warmth penetrated
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the autumn, the swallows fly away to warmer
countries; and when a weak one is among them,
and the cold freezes him, he falls upon the ground,
and lies there as if dead, until the cold snow covers
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellise was frightened at first, when the bird raised
itself, for to her he was a great big giant, but she
soon collected herself again, pressed the hay covering
close round the exhausted little animal, and
then went to fetch the curled mint-leaves which
served for her own covering, that she might lay it
over his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following night she slipped away to the bird
again, whom she found now quite revived, but yet so
very weak, that he could only open his eyes now
and then, to look at Ellise, who lighted up his face
with a little piece of tinder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you a thousand times, you lovely little
child,” said the sick swallow, “I am now so
thoroughly warmed through, that I shall soon gain
my strength again, and shall be able to fly out in the
warm sunshine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! it is a great deal too cold out there,” returned
Ellise, “it snows and freezes so hard! only just
stay now in your warm bed, and I will take such
care of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brought the bird some water to drink out of a
leaf, and then he related to her how he had so hurt
his wing against a thorny bush that he could not fly
away to the warm countries with his comrades, and
at last had fallen exhausted to the ground, where all
consciousness left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little swallow remained here the whole winter,
and Ellise attended to him, and became every
day more and more fond of him; yet she said nothing
at all about it to the mole or the field-mouse, for she
knew well enough already that neither of them could
bear the poor bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon, however, as the summer came, and the
warm sunbeams penetrated the earth, the swallow
said good-bye to Ellise, who had now opened the
hole in the ground, through which the mole let the
light fall in. The sun shone so kindly, that the
swallow turned and asked Ellise, his dear little
nurse, whether she would not fly away with him.
She could sit very nicely upon the swallow’s back,
and then they would go away together to the green
forest. But Ellise thought it would grieve the
good field-mouse if she went away secretly, and
therefore she was obliged to refuse the bird’s kind
offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, once more farewell, you kind, good
maiden,” said the swallow, and therewith he flew
out into the sunshine. Ellise looked sorrowfully
after him, and the tears rushed into her eyes, for she
was very fond of the good bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quivit! quivit!” sang the swallow, and away he
flew to the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Ellise was very mournful, for she hardly
ever left her dark hole. The corn grew up far above
her head, and formed quite a thick wood round the
house of the field-mouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you can spend the summer in working at
your wedding-clothes,” said the field-mouse, for the
neighbor, the wearisome mole, had at last really
proposed for Ellise. “I will give you every thing
you want, that you may have all things comfortable
about you, when you are the mole’s wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Ellise was obliged to sit all day long busy
at her clothes, and the field-mouse took four clever
spiders into her service, and kept them weaving day
and night. Every evening came the mole to pay his
visit, and every evening he expressed his wish that
the summer would soon come to an end, and the
heat cease, for then, when the winter was here, his
wedding should take place. But Ellise was not at
all happy to hear this, for she could hardly bear even
to look upon the ugly mole, for all his expensive
velvet coat. Every evening and every morning she
went out at the door, and when the wind blew the
ears of corn apart, and she could look upon the blue
heaven, she saw it was so beautiful out in the open
air, that she wished she could only see the dear
swallow once more; but the swallow never came;
he preferred rejoicing himself in the warm sunbeams
in the green woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time autumn came, Ellise had prepared all
her wedding-garments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In four weeks your wedding will take place,”
said the field-mouse to her; but Ellise wept, and
said she did not want to have the stupid mole for a
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddle-de-dee,” answered the field-mouse—“Come,
don’t be obstinate, or I shall be obliged to
bite you with my sharp teeth. Isn’t he a good husband
that you’re going to have? Why, even the
queen hasn’t such a fine velvet coat to show as he
has! His kitchen and his cellar are well-stocked,
and you ought rather to thank Providence for providing
so well for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the wedding was to be! Already was the mole
come to fetch away Ellise, who, from henceforth,
was to live always with him. Deep under the
earth, where no sunbeam could ever come! The
little maiden was very unhappy, that she must
take her farewell of the friendly sun, which at all
events she saw at the door of the field-mouse’s
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farewell, thou beloved sun!” said she, and
raised her hands toward heaven, while she advanced
a few steps from the door; for already was the corn
again reaped, and she stood once more among the
stubble in the field. “Adieu, adieu!” she repeated,
and threw her arms round a flower that stood near
her, “Greet the little swallow for me, when you see
him again,” added she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quivit! quivit!” echoed near her in the same
moment, and, as Ellise raised her eyes, she saw her
well-known little swallow fly past. As soon as the
swallow perceived Ellise, he too, became quite joyful,
and hastened at once to his kind nurse; and she
told him how unwilling she was to have the ugly
mole for her husband, and that she must go down
deep into the earth, where neither sun nor moon
could ever look upon her, and with these words she
burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See now,” said the swallow, “the cold winter
is coming again, and I am flying away to the warm
countries, will you come and travel with me? I will
carry you gladly on my back. You need only to
bind yourself fast with your girdle, so we can fly
away far from the disagreeable mole, and his dark
house, far over mountains and valleys, to the beautiful
countries, where the sun shines much warmer
than it does here; where there is summer always,
and always beautiful flowers blooming. Come, be
comforted, and fly away with me, dear, kind Ellise,
who saved my life when I lay frozen in the earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will go with you,” cried Ellise joyfully.
She mounted on the back of the swallow, set her
feet upon his out-spread wings, bound herself with
her girdle to a strong feather, and flew off with the
swallow through the air, over woods and lakes, valleys
and mountains. Very often Ellise suffered from
the cold when they went over icy glaciers and snowy
rocks; but then she concealed herself under the
wings and among the feathers of the bird, and merely
put out her head to gaze and wonder at all the glorious
things around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, too, they came into the warm countries.
The sun shines there clearer than with us; the
heavens were a great deal higher, and on the walls
and in the hedges grew the most beautiful blue and
green grapes. In the woods hung ripe citrons and
oranges, and the air was full of the scent of thyme
and myrtle, while beautiful children ran in the roads
playing with the gayest colored butterflies. But farther
and farther flew the swallow, and below them
it became more and more beautiful. By the side of
a lake, beneath graceful acacias, there rose an ancient
marble palace, the vines clung around the pillars,
while above them, on their summits, hung many
a swallow’s nest. Into one of these nests the bird
carried Ellise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is my house,” said he, “but look you for
one of the loveliest flowers, which grow down there,
for your home, and I will carry you there, and you
shall have every thing you can possibly want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be glorious indeed!” said Ellise,
and she clapped her hands together for very joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the earth there lay a large white marble pillar,
which had been thrown down, and was broken
into three pieces, but between its ruins there grew
the very fairest flowers, all white, the loveliest you
would ever wish to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swallow flew with Ellise to one of these
flowers, and set her down upon a broad leaf; but how
astonished was Ellise when she saw that a wee little
man sat in this flower, who was as fine and transparent
as glass. He wore a graceful little crown upon
his head, and had beautiful wings on his shoulders;
and withal he was not a bit bigger than Ellise herself.
He was the angel of this flower. In every
flower dwell a pair of such like little men and women,
but this was the king of all the flower angels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens! how handsome this king is,” whispered
Ellise into the ear of the swallow. The little
prince was somewhat startled by the arrival of the
large bird; but when he saw Ellise, he became instantly
in love with her; for she was the most charming
little maiden that he had ever seen. So he took
off his golden crown, set it upon Ellise, and asked
what was her name, and whether she would be his
wife; if so, she should be queen over all the other
flowers—ah! this was a very different husband to the
son of the hideous toad, and the heavy, stupid mole,
with his velvet coat! So Ellise said yes, to the
beautiful prince; and now, from all the other
flowers, appeared either a gentleman or a lady, all
wonderfully elegant and beautiful, to bring presents
to Ellise. The best presents offered to her was a
pair of exquisite white wings, which were immediately
fastened on her; and now she could fly from
flower to flower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the joy was universal. The little swallow
sat above in his nest, and sang as well as he possibly
could, though at the same time he was sorely
grieved, for he was so fond of Ellise that he wanted
never to part from her again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall not be called <span class='it'>Ellise</span> any more,” said
the flower-angel, “for it is not at all a pretty name,
and you are so pretty! But from this moment you
shall be called Maja.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farewell! Farewell!” cried the little swallow,
and away he flew again, out of the warm land, far,
far away, to the little Denmark, where he had his
summer nest over the window of the good man, who
knows how to tell stories, that he might sing his
Quivit! Quivit! before him. And it is from him,
the little swallow, that Granny learnt all this wonderful
history.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A series</span> of curious and interesting phenomena,
involving the apparent elevation and approach of distant
objects, the production of aerial images of terrestrial
forms, of double images, their inversion, and
distortion into an endless variety of grotesque shapes,
together with the deceptive aspect given to the
desert-landscape, are comprehended in the class of
optical illusions. Different varieties of this singular
visual effect constitute the <span class='it'>mirage</span> of the French, the
<span class='it'>fata morgana</span> of the Italians, the <span class='it'>looming</span> of our
seamen, and the <span class='it'>glamur</span> of the Highlanders. It is
not peculiar to any particular country, though more
common in some than others, and most frequently
observed near the margin of lakes and rivers, by the
sea-shore, in mountain districts and on level plains.
These phantoms are perfectly explicable upon optical
principles, and though influenced by local combinations,
they are mainly referable to one common cause,
the refractive and reflective properties of the atmosphere,
and inequalities of refraction arising from the
intermixture of strata of air of different temperatures
and densities. But such appearances in former
times were really converted by the imagination of
the vulgar into supernatural realities; and hence
many of the goblin stories with which the world has
been rife, not yet banished from the discipline to
which childhood is subject,—</p>

Imaus, and Pomponius Mela those of Mauritania,
behind Mount Atlas, as peculiarly subject to these
spectral appearances. Diodorus Siculus likewise
refers to the regions of Africa, situated in the neighborhood
of Cyrene, as another chosen site:—“Even,”
says he, “in the severest weather, there are sometimes
seen in the air certain condensed exhalations
that represent the figures of all kinds of animals;
occasionally they seem to be motionless, and in perfect
quietude; and occasionally to be flying; while
immediately afterward they themselves appear to
be the pursuers, and to make other objects fly before
them.” Milton might have had this passage in his
eye when he penned the allusion to the same apparitions:—</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>The Mirage of the Desert.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The mirage is the most familiar form of optical
illusion. M. Monge, one of the French savans, who
accompanied Buonaparte in his expedition to Egypt,
witnessed a remarkable example. In the desert between
Alexandria and Cairo, in all directions green
islands appeared, surrounded by extensive lakes of
pure, transparent water. Nothing could be conceived
more lovely or picturesque than the landscape.
In the tranquil surface of the lakes, the trees
and houses with which the islands were covered
were strongly reflected with vivid and varied hues,
and the party hastened forward to enjoy the refreshments
apparently proffered them. But when they
arrived, the lake on whose bosom they floated, the
trees among whose foliage they arose, and the people
who stood on the shore inviting their approach,
had all vanished; and nothing remained but the uniform
and irksome desert of sand and sky, with a
few naked huts and ragged Arabs. But for being
undeceived by an actual progress to the spot, one and
all would have remained firm in the conviction that
these visionary trees and lakes had a real existence
in the desert. M. Monge attributed the liquid expanse,
tantalizing the eye with an unfaithful representation
of what was earnestly desired, to an inverted
image of the cerulean sky, intermixed with
the ground scenery. This kind of mirage is known
in Persia and Arabia by the name of <span class='it'>Serab</span> or miraculous
water, and in the western deserts of India by
that of <span class='it'>Tehittram</span>, a picture. It occurs as a common
emblem of disappointment in the poetry of the
orientals.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>Atmospheric Illusion.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the Philosophical Transactions for the year
1798, an account is given by W. Latham, Esq.,
F.R.S., of an instance of lateral refraction observed
by him, by which the coast of Picardy, with its
more prominent objects, was brought apparently close
to that of Hastings. On July the 26th, about five in
the afternoon, while sitting in his dining-room, near
the sea-shore, attention was excited by a crowd of
people running down to the beach. Upon inquiring
the reason, it appeared that the coast of France was
plainly to be distinguished with the naked eye.
Upon proceeding to the shore, he found, that without
the assistance of a telescope, he could distinctly see
the cliffs across the Channel, which, at the nearest
points, are from forty to fifty miles distant, and are
not to be discovered, from that low situation, by the
aid of the best glasses. They appeared to be only
a few miles off, and seemed to extend for some
leagues along the coast. At first the sailors and
fishermen could not be persuaded of the reality
of the appearance, but they soon became thoroughly
convinced, by the cliffs gradually appearing more
elevated, and seeming to approach nearer, that
they were able to point out the different places
they had been accustomed to visit, such as the Bay,
the Old Head, and the Windmill at Boulogne, St.
Vallery, and several other spots. Their remark
was that these places appeared as near as if they
were sailing at a small distance into the harbor.
The apparition of the opposite cliffs varied in distinctness
and apparent contiguity for nearly an hour,
but it was never out of sight, and upon leaving the
beach for a hill of some considerable height, Mr.
Latham could at once see Dungeness and Dover
cliffs on each side, and before him the French coast
from Calais to near Dieppe. By the telescope the
French fishing-boats were clearly seen at anchor,
and the different colors of the land on the heights,
with the buildings, were perfectly discernible. The
spectacle continued in the highest splendor until
past eight o’clock, though a black cloud obscured
the face of the sun for some time, when it gradually
faded away. This was the first time within the
memory of the oldest inhabitants, that they had ever
caught sight of the opposite shore. The day had
been extremely hot, and not a breath of wind had
stirred since the morning, when the small pennons
at the mast-heads of the fishing-boats in the harbor
had been at all points of the compass. Professor
Vince witnessed a similar apparent approximation
of the coast of France to that of Ramsgate, for at
the very edge of the water he discerned the Calais
cliffs a very considerable height above the horizon,
whereas they are frequently not to be seen in clear
weather from the high lands above the town. A
much greater breadth of coast also appeared than is
usually observed under the most favorable circumstances.
The ordinary refractive power of the
atmosphere is thus liable to be strikingly altered by
a change of temperature and humidity, so that a hill
which at one time appears low, may at another be
seen towering aloft; and a city in a neighboring
valley, may from a certain station be entirely invisible,
or it may show the tops of its buildings, just
as if its foundations had been raised, according to
the condition of the aerial medium between it and
the spectator.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>Fata Morgana at Reggio.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of all instances of spectral illusion, the <span class='it'>fata morgana</span>,
familiar to the inhabitants of Sicily, is the
most curious and striking. It occurs off the Pharo
of Messina, in the strait which separates Sicily from
Calabria, and had been variously described by different
observers, owing, doubtless, to the different
conditions of the atmosphere at the respective times
of observation. The spectacle consists in the images
of men, cattle, houses, rocks, and trees, pictured
upon the surface of the water, and in the air immediately
over the water, as if called into existence by
an enchanter’s wand, the same object having frequently
two images, one in the natural and the other
in an inverted position. A combination of circumstances
must concur to produce this novel panorama.
The spectator, standing with his back to the east on
an elevated place, commands a view of the strait.
No wind must be abroad to ruffle the surface of the
sea; and the waters must be pressed up by currents,
which is occasionally the case, to a considerable
height, in the middle of the strait, so that they may
present a slight convex surface. When these conditions
are fulfilled, and the sun has risen over the
Calabrian heights so as to make an angle of 45° with
the horizon, the various objects on the shore at
Reggio, opposite to Messina, are transferred to the
middle of the strait, forming an immovable landscape
of rocks, trees, and houses, and a movable
one of men, horses, and cattle, upon the surface of
the water. If the atmosphere, at the same time, is
highly charged with vapor, the phenomena apparent
on the water will also be visible in the air, occupying
a space which extends from the surface to the
height of about twenty-five feet. Two kinds of
morgana may therefore be discriminated; the first,
at the surface of the sea, or the marine morgana;
the second, in the air, or the aerial. The term applied
to this strange exhibition of uncertain derivation,
but supposed by some to refer to the vulgar
presumption of the spectacle being produced by a
fairy or magician. The populace are said to hail
the vision with great exultation, calling every one
abroad to partake of the sight, with the cry of
“Morgana, morgana!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Angelucci, an eye-witness, describes the
scene in the following terms:—“On the 15th of
August, 1643, as I stood at my window, I was surprised
with a most wonderful, delectable vision.
The sea that washes the Sicilian shore swelled up,
and became, for ten miles in length, like a chain of
dark mountains; while the waters near our Calabrian
coast grew quite smooth, and in an instant appeared
as one clear polished mirror, reclining against
the aforesaid ridge. On this glass was depicted, in
<span class='it'>chiaro scuro</span>, a string of several thousands of pilasters,
all equal in altitude, distance, and degree of
light and shade. In a moment they lost half their
height, and bent into arcades, like Roman aqueducts.
A long cornice was next formed on the top, and
above it rose castles innumerable, all perfectly alike.
These soon split into towers, which were shortly
after lost in colonnades, then windows, and at last
ended in pines, cypresses, and other trees, even and
similar. This was the Fata Morgana, which, for
twenty-six years, I had thought a mere fable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brydone, writing from Messina, evidently in a
dubious vein, states:—“Do you know, the most extraordinary
phenomenon in the world is often observed
near to this place? I laughed at it at first, as
you will do, but I am now convinced of its reality,
and am persuaded, too, that if ever it had been
thoroughly examined by a philosophical eye, the
natural cause must long ago have been assigned. It
has often been remarked, both by the ancients and
moderns, that in the heat of summer, after the sea and
air have been much agitated by winds, and a perfect
calm succeeds, there appears, about the time of
dawn, in that part of the heavens over the straits, a
great variety of singular forms, some at rest, and
some moving about with great velocity. These
forms, in proportion as the light increases, seem to
become more aerial, till at last some time before
sunrise they entirely disappear. The Sicilians represent
this as the most beautiful sight in nature.
Leanti, one of their latest and best writers, came
here on purpose to see it. He says the heavens appeared
crowded with a variety of objects: he mentions
palaces, woods, gardens, etc., besides the
figures of men and other animals, that appear in
motion amongst them. No doubt the imagination
must be greatly aiding in forming this aerial creation;
but as so many of their authors, both ancient
and modern, agree in the fact, and give an account
of it from their own observation, there certainly
must be some foundation for the story. There is
one Giardini, a Jesuit, who has lately written a
treatise upon this phenomenon, but I have not been
able to find it. The celebrated Messinese Gallo has
likewise published something on this singular subject.
The common people, according to custom,
give the whole merit to the devil; and, indeed, it is
by much the shortest and easiest way of accounting
for it. Those who pretend to be philosophers, and
refuse him this honor, are greatly puzzled what to
make of it. They think it may be owing to some
uncommon refraction or reflection of the rays, from
the water of the straits, which, as it is at that time
carried about in a variety of eddies and vortices,
must consequently, say they, make a variety of appearances
on any medium where it is reflected.
This, I think, is nonsense, or at least very near it.
I suspect it is something of the nature of our aurora
borealis, and, like many of the great phenomena of
nature, depends upon electrical cause; which, in
future ages, I have little doubt, will be found to be
as powerful an agent in regulating the universe as
gravity is in this age, or as the subtle fluid was in
the last. The electrical fluid in this country of
volcanoes, is probably produced in a much greater
quantity than in any other. The air, strongly impregnated
with this matter, and confined betwixt
two ridges of mountains—at the same time exceedingly
agitated from below by the violence of the
current, and the impetuous whirling of the waters—may
it not be supposed to produce a variety of appearances?
And may not the lively Sicilian imaginations,
animated by a belief in demons, and all
the wild offspring of superstition, give these appearances
as great a variety of forms? Remember,
I do not say it is so; and hope yet to have it in my
power to give you a better account of this matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ingenious as Brydone was, he here indulges a
most unfortunate speculation, which, had he enjoyed
the good fortune of personally observing the
phenomenon, most likely, he would not have proposed.
It is to be accounted for upon optical principles,
which M. Biot, in his <span class='it'>Astronomie Physique</span>,
thus applies, from Minasi’s dissertation upon the
subject:—“When the rising sun shines from that
point whence its incident ray forms an angle of forty-five
degrees, on the sea of Reggio, and the bright
surface of the water in the bay is not disturbed either
by wind or current—when the tide is at its height,
and the waters are pressed up by the currents to a
great elevation in the middle of the channel; the
spectator being placed on an eminence, with his back
to the sun, and his face to the sea, the mountains of
Messina rising like a wall behind it, and forming the
back-ground of the picture—on a sudden there appear
in the water, as in a catoptric theatre, various
multiplied objects—numberless series of pilasters,
arches, castles, well-delineated regular columns,
lofty towers, superb palaces, with balconies and
windows, extended alleys of trees, delightful plains,
with herds and flocks, armies of men on foot, on
horseback, and many other things, in their natural
colors and proper actions, passing rapidly in succession
along the surface of the sea, during the
whole of the short period of time while the above-mentioned
causes remain. The objects are proved,
by accurate observations of the coast of Reggio, to
be derived from objects on shore. If, in addition to
the circumstances already described, the atmosphere
be highly impregnated with vapor and dense exhalations,
not previously dispersed by the action of the
wind and waves, or rarified by the sun, it then happens
that, in this vapor, as in a curtain extended
along the channel to the height of above forty palms,
and nearly down to the sea, the observer will behold
the scene of the same objects not only reflected
on the surface of the sea, but likewise in the air,
though not so distinctly or well-defined. Lastly, if the
air be slightly hazy and opaque, and at the same time
dewy, and adapted to form the iris, then the above-mentioned
objects will appear only at the surface of
the sea, as in the first case, but all vividly colored
or fringed with red, green, blue, or other prismatic
colors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aerial images of terrestrial objects are frequently
produced as the simple effect of reflection. Dr. Buchan
mentions the following occurrence:—“Walking
on the cliff about a mile to the east of Brighton,
on the morning of the 18th of November, 1804, while
watching the rising of the sun, I turned my eyes directly
to the sea, just as the solar disc emerged from
the surface of the water, and saw the face of the
cliff on which I was standing represented precisely
opposite to me, at some distance from the ocean.
Calling the attention of my companion to this appearance,
we soon also discovered our own figures
standing on the summit of the opposite apparent
cliff, as well as the representation of a windmill near
at hand. The reflected images were most distinct
precisely opposite to where we stood; and the false
cliff seemed to fade away, and to draw near to the
real one, in proportion as it receded toward the west.
This phenomenon lasted about ten minutes, till the
sun had risen nearly his own diameter above the
sea. The whole then seemed to be elevated into the
air, and successively disappeared. The surface of
the sea was covered with a dense fog of many yards
in height, and which gradually receded before the
rays of the sun.” In December, 1826, a similar circumstance
excited some consternation among the
parishioners of Miqué, in the neighborhood of
Poitiers, in France. They were engaged in the exercises
of the jubilee which preceded the festival of
Christmas, and about three thousand persons from
the surrounding parishes were assembled. At five
o’clock in the evening, when one of the clergy was
addressing the multitude, and reminding them of the
cross which appeared in the sky to Constantine and
his army, suddenly a similar cross appeared in the
heavens, just before the porch of the church, about
two hundred feet above the horizon, and a hundred
and forty feet in length, of a bright silver color tinged
with red, and perfectly well-defined. Such was the
effect of this vision, that the people immediately
threw themselves upon their knees, and united
together in one of their canticles. The fact was,
that a large wooden cross, twenty-five feet high, had
been erected beside the church as a part of the ceremony,
the figure of which was formed in the air,
and reflected back to the eyes of the spectators, retaining
exactly the same shape and proportions, but
changed in position and dilated in size. Its red
tinge was also the color of the object of which it was
the reflected image. When the rays of the sun
were withdrawn the figure vanished.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>Spectre of the Brocken.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The peasantry in the neighborhood of the Harz
Mountains formerly stood in no little awe of the
gigantic spectre of the Brocken—the figure of a man
observed to walk the clouds over the ridge at sunrise.
This apparition has long been resolved into an
exaggerated reflection, which makes the traveler’s
shadow, pictured upon the clouds, appear a colossal
figure of immense dimensions. A French savan,
attended by a friend, went to watch this spectral
shape, but for many mornings they traversed an opposite
ridge in vain. At length, however, it was
discovered, having also a companion, and both
figures were found imitating all the motions of the
philosopher and his friend. The ancient classical
fable of Niobe on Mount Sipylus belongs to the same
category of atmospheric deceptions; and the tales,
common in mountainous countries, of troops of horse
and armies marching and counter-marching in the
air, have been only the reflection of horses pasturing
upon an opposite height, or of the forms of travelers
pursuing their journey. On the 19th of August,
1820, Mr. Menzies, a surgeon of Glasgow, and Mr.
Macgregor began to ascend the mountain of Ben
Lomond, about five o’clock in the afternoon. They
had not proceeded far before they were overtaken
by a smart shower; but as it appeared only to be
partial, they continued their journey, and by the time
they were half way up, the cloud passed away, and
most delightful weather succeeded. Thin, transparent
vapors, which appeared to have risen from
Loch Lomond beneath, were occasionally seen
floating before a gentle and refreshing breeze; in
other respects, as far as the eye could trace, the sky
was clear, and the atmosphere serene. They
reached the summit about half-past seven o’clock,
in time to see the sun sinking beneath the western
hills. Its parting beams had gilded the mountain-tops
with a warm glowing color; and the surface of
the lake, gently rippling with the breeze, was tinged
with a yellow lustre. While admiring the adjacent
mountains, hills, and valleys, and the expanse of
water beneath, interspersed with numerous wooded
islands, the attention of one of the party was attracted
by a cloud in the east, partly of a dark red
color, apparently at the distance of two miles and a
half, in which he distinctly observed two gigantic
figures, standing, as it were, on a majestic pedestal.
He immediately pointed out the phenomenon to his
companion; and they distinctly perceived one of the
gigantic figures, in imitation, strike the other on the
shoulder, and point toward them. They then made
their obeisance to the airy phantoms, which was
instantly returned. They waved their hats and
umbrellas, and the shadowy figures did the same.
Like other travelers, they had carried with them a
bottle of usquebaugh, and amused themselves in
drinking to the figures, which was of course duly
returned. In short, every movement which they
made, they could observe distinctly repeated by the
figures in the cloud. The appearance continued
about a quarter of an hour. A gentle breeze from
the north carried the cloud slowly away; the
figures became less and less distinct, and at last
vanished. North of the village of Comrie, in Perthshire,
there is a bold hill called Dunmore, with a
pillar of seventy or eighty feet in height built on its
summit in memory of the late Lord Melville. At
about eight o’clock of the evening of the 21st of
August, of the year 1845, a perfect image of this
well-known hill and obelisk, as exact as the shadow
usually represents the substance, was distinctly observed
projecting on the northern sky, at least two
miles beyond the original, which, owing to an intervening
eminence, was not itself at all in view from
the station where the aerial picture was observed.
The figure continued visible for about ten minutes
after it was first seen, and was minutely examined
by three individuals. One of these fancied that
there was a projection at the base of the monument,
as represented in the air, which was not in the
original; but, upon examining the latter the next
morning, the image was found to have been more
faithful than his memory; for there stood the prototype
of the projection, in the shape of a clump of
trees, at the base of the real obelisk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In northern latitudes the effects of atmospheric
reflection and refraction are very familiar to the natives.
By the term of <span class='it'>uphillanger</span> the Icelanders
denote the elevation of distant objects,
which is regarded as a presage
of fine weather. Not only is
there an increase in the vertical
dimensions of the objects affected,
so that low coasts frequently assume
a bold and precipitous outline,
the objects sunk below the
horizon are brought into view,
with their natural position changed
and distorted. In 1818, Captain
Scoresby relates that, when in the
polar sea, his ship had been separated
for some time from that of his
father, which he had been looking
out for with great anxiety. At
length, one evening, to his astonishment,
he beheld the vessel suspended
in the air in an inverted position,
with the most distinct and
perfect representation. Sailing in
the direction of this visionary appearance,
he met with the real ship
by this indication. It was found
that the vessel had been thirty miles
distant, and seventeen beyond the
horizon, when her spectrum was
thus elevated into the air by this extraordinary
refraction. Sometimes
two images of a vessel are seen,
the one erect and the other inverted, with their
topmasts or their hulls meeting, according as the
inverted image is above or below the other. Dr.
Wollaston has shown that the production of these
images is owing to the refraction of the rays through
media of different densities. Looking along a red-hot
poker at a distant object, two images of it were
seen, one erect and the other inverted, arising from
the change produced by the heat in the density of
the air. A singular instance of lateral mirage was
noticed upon the Lake of Geneva by MM. Jurine and
Soret, in the year 1818. A bark near Bellerire was
seen approaching to the city by the left bank of the
lake; and at the same time an image of the sails was
observed above the water, which, instead of following
the direction of the bark, separated from it, and
appeared approaching by the <span class='it'>right</span> bank—the image
moving from east to west, and the bark from north
to south. When the image separated from the
vessel, it was of the same dimensions as the bark;
but it diminished as it receded from it, so as to be
reduced to one-half when the appearance ceased.
This was a striking example of refraction, operating
in a lateral as well as a vertical direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Ignis Fatuus.</span> This wandering meteor known
to the vulgar as the Will-o’-the-Wisp, has given rise
to considerable speculation and controversy. Burying-grounds,
fields of battle, low meadows, valleys,
and marshes, are its ordinary haunts. By some eminent
naturalists, particularly Willoughby and Ray,
it has been maintained to be only the shining of a
great number of the male glow-worms in England,
and the pyraustæ in Italy, flying together—an opinion
to which Mr. Kirby, the entomologist, inclines. The
luminosities observed in several cases may have been
due to this cause, but the true meteor of the marshes
cannot thus be explained. The following instance
is abridged from the Entomological Magazine:—“Two
travelers proceeding across the moors between
Hexham and Alston, were startled, about ten
o’clock at night, by the sudden appearance of a light
close to the road-side, about the size of the hand,
and of a well-defined oval form. The place was
very wet, and the peat-moss had been dug out, leaving
what are locally termed ‘peat-pots,’ which soon
fill with water, nourishing a number of confervæ,
and the various species of sphagnum, which are
converted into peat. During the process of decomposition
these places give out large quantities of
gas. The light was about three feet from the
ground, hovering over the peat-pots, and it moved
nearly parallel with the road for about fifty yards,
when it vanished, probably from the failure of the
gas. The manner in which it disappeared was
similar to that of a candle being blown out.” We
have the best account of it from Mr. Blesson, who
examined it abroad with great care and diligence.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i042.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0011' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>Ignis Fatuus.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The first time,” he states, “I saw the ignis
fatuus was in a valley in the forest of Gorbitz, in the
New Mark. This valley cuts deeply in compact
loam, and is marshy on its lower part. The water
of the marsh is ferruginous, and covered with an
iridescent crust. During the day bubbles of air were
seen rising from it, and in the night blue flames were
observed shooting from and playing over its surface.
As I suspected that there was some connection between
these flames and the bubbles of air, I marked
during the day-time the place where the latter rose
up most abundantly, and repaired thither during the
night; to my great joy I actually observed bluish-purple
flames, and did not hesitate to approach them.
On reaching the spot they retired, and I pursued
them in vain; all attempts to examine them closely
were ineffectual. Some days of very rainy weather
prevented further investigation, but afforded leisure
for reflecting on their nature. I conjectured that the
motion of the air, on my approaching the spot, forced
forward the burning gas, and remarked that the
flame burned darker when it was blown aside; hence
I concluded that a continuous thin stream of inflammable
air was formed by these bubbles, which, once
inflamed, continued to burn, but which, owing to
the paleness of the light of the flame, could not be
observed during the day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ignis fatuus of the church-yard and the battle-field
arise from the phosphuretted hydrogen emitted
by animal matter in a state of putrefaction, which
always inflames upon contact with the oxygen of the
atmosphere; and the flickering meteor of the marsh
may be referred to the carburetted hydrogen, formed
by the decomposition of vegetable matter in stagnant
water, ignited by a discharge of the electric fluid.</p>

were all closed—no smoke issued from their rude
chimneys—no sound or motion broke the stillness.
Apart from its solitude, however, it was a beautiful
scene. The haziness of the evening before was
now gone—the valley was refreshed by the dew of
the night; and the reviving influence of the cool
morning seemed to have had its effect upon the inanimate
as well as the animate. The slope of the
hills on the north, where the first rays of the sun
rested for hours before they touched the southern
plateau, was dotted here and there by straggling
goats, browsing listlessly upon the scanty vegetation;
while lower down the valley and along the banks of
the little river, numbers of cattle were either standing
patiently around the inclosures or wandering slowly
away toward the hills. The river, silvered by the
morning light, wound thread-like down the valley toward
the west, and was visible even to the turn of
the mountain miles away, where it enters the labyrinth
of ridges in the neighborhood of Parras.
There were no waving fields of grain; but the
hedges were all green and fresh; verdure was
springing even at that season, where the ground had
been cleared of its products; and the evergreen
trees, and groves of oranges which dotted the land
imparted an aspect of fertile beauty. The shadows
of the rugged hills were traceable along the ground,
so clearly that the line of separation could be followed
through the fields—one-half in sunlight, half
in shade—the former gradually encroaching on the
latter. There were no birds to cheer the solitude
with matin songs; but so peaceful was the scene
that even their presence might have seemed unwelcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harding gazed about him as he crossed the bridge
as if in search of the road. There were two paths;
one leading along the front of several <span class='it'>ranchos</span>, and
apparently taking him directly to the point he wished
to reach. The other led away to the left, sweeping
round the fields and avoiding the houses, with the
danger of meeting their inmates. It was the latter
that the count directed him to take; but for some
reason best known to himself he followed the first,
without heeding De Marsiac’s hail, and soon found
himself riding slowly between two straggling rows
of neat cottages. There was no one astir, however,
and he had ridden nearly the whole length of the
avenue without seeing any signs of life—when,
judging himself to be out of view of <span class='it'>Embocadura</span>,
he turned his horse in among the elms, and sprang to
the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing his bridle-rein over a limb, he first
carefully examined his pistols, and then loosening
his sword in the scabbard, stepped out from the
cover and approached the nearest cottage. It was
not until he had knocked several times that any answer
was returned. Then, however, the door was
suddenly swung open, and he was confronted by one
of those specimens of Mexican youth, whose faces
combine in so remarkable a degree, great beauty
with an expression of wicked cunning. He was a
boy—perhaps eighteen years of age, with a slender
figure, but evidently very active, and unless an exception
to his race, capable of enduring great fatigue
and privation. His eyes were dark as night, small,
and keen; his nose thin and straight, his lips rather
pinched, but red and clearly cut. The rest of his
features were appropriate to these, and his complexion
was rather lighter than the general hue of
his people. He held a <span class='it'>lareat</span> coiled in his hand, and
his goat-skin shoes were armed at the heel with
enormous spurs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Buenas dias, Señor</span>,” said he, in a clear, sharp
voice, stepping back at the same time, in mute invitation
to Harding to enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter returned the salutation and asked—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On whose lands are these <span class='it'>ranchos</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On those of La Señora Eltorena,” answered the
boy, promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is it to Anelo?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve leagues, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harding reflected for a moment, and then beckoned
the boy aside. The latter gazed at him inquiringly;
but drawing the door to, followed him to the place
where his horse was standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see that horse?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” answered the boy “and a very fine one
he is, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you ride him to Anelo and back,<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much money could I get to do it?” asked
the youth, eyeing the officer as if to measure his liberality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty dollars,” Harding answered; “or, if
you do not find me on your return, you may keep
the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agreed,” said the boy, promptly. “I’ll set out
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harding took a blank leaf from his pocket-book
and wrote a note to the commandant of a detachment
of Texan rangers, whom he knew to be then foraging
at Anelo, and handed it to the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be back before midnight,” said he;
“and you may ask for me at the <span class='it'>hacienda</span>. My name
is Harding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And mine is Eltorena,” said the youth. “I am
six months older than Margarita, and entitled to the
name by the same right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes glistened as he spoke with an expression
so devilish, that Harding was half inclined to take
back the note and discharge him. But while reflecting
upon the words of the boy, the latter, as if divining
his half formed intention, suddenly put spurs to
his horse’s flanks and bounded away. Harding
watched him until he had crossed the river, and
avoiding <span class='it'>La Embocadura</span> by a wide circuit, was
fast disappearing among the groves to the east.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concluding that if he had made a mistake it was
now too late to amend it, he turned on his heel, and
was about to pursue his way toward <span class='it'>Piedritas</span> on
foot, when his attention was arrested by a voice pronouncing
his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señor Harding, let me speak with you for a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned, and beheld a female in the very bloom
of mature womanhood—tall, elegantly formed, and
possessing a countenance of singular force and
beauty. She was standing near the door at which
he had knocked, and he had no difficulty in determining
from the resemblance that she was the
mother of his messenger. He advanced with the
ordinary salutation, and followed her within the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am perfectly well acquainted,” she commenced
abruptly, without offering him a seat, “with the object
of your visit to the <span class='it'>hacienda</span>. You are here
to wed the daughter of the woman who calls herself
the Señora Eltorena—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Calls herself!” repeated Harding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are doubtless like other men,” she continued,
without noticing the exclamation, “more
attracted by the property than the bride. Now, I
wish to warn you that this estate, with all that the
late Colonel Eltorena owned, belongs to his son—and
mine—the youth whom you have just sent away;
and that I hold General Santa Anna’s pledge to see
him righted as soon as the army marches this way.
So, if you marry her, it is with your eyes open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken, madam,” said Harding, after
a pause given to surprise; “I am here on no such
errand: I am, on the contrary,” he added, with a
smile, “only a humble ambassador, suing for the
lady’s hand in the name of another, more potent individual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the name of the murdering thief, De Marsiac?”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so,” Harding replied, “the very same,
without mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a strange ambassador,” she said, with a
laugh. “But,” she continued, resuming her somewhat
wild manner, “I warn him through you, as I
have done to his face, that the man who marries
that woman’s daughter, must take her portionless!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case,” said Harding, with another smile,
“I doubt whether the count will care to take her at
all. But enlighten me about your son’s title—it may
be important to my principal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her story was not an uncommon one, though it
took a long time in telling; for she dwelt with painful
emphasis upon some parts, and talked so incoherently
upon others, that Harding was confirmed in
his suspicion that her mind was, upon that subject at
least, quite unsettled. She had been induced by the
late Colonel Eltorena to go to his house, as his wife,
under a promise that the actual ceremony should
be performed by the first priest who came from
Monclova or Saltillo. It was a remote district in
which they lived, and they might have to wait for
months before the expected visit would be made;
and knowing this, and at the earnest solicitation of
her lover, she consented to an arrangement, which
was not so uncommon as it should have been.
Wherever the common law prevails as it does in
the United States, this would have been a legal
marriage; and she solemnly protested that she so
considered it upon the representation of the colonel
himself. Two or three priests had passed that way
within a few months; but upon various pretexts the
ceremony was postponed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, after about six months, the Colonel went
to the city of Mexico on a visit, and returned with a
wife! “The woman,” said the narrator, “who now
calls herself La Señora Eltorena!” <span class='it'>She</span>, the deceived
and betrayed, was generously offered an asylum
in the <span class='it'>rancho</span>, where she had lived ever since;
and six months after her ejectment from the <span class='it'>hacienda</span>
by “the proud English woman,” her son was
born. For eighteen years she had been suing for
her rights; but superior influence with the corrupt
judges of that unhappy land had foiled all her
efforts; and in the meantime, she had lived in plain
view of the <span class='it'>hacienda</span>, determined never to lose sight
of her object, until she saw her son in possession.
She had never been inside of its walls: “but,” said
she, “I <span class='it'>will</span> be there—and soon! May God give me
revenge upon the sorceress, who stole away my
rights!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a very hard case,” said Harding, when she
had finished, “but I fear like many other wrongs, it
has no remedy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one remedy,” said she, significantly,
“when all others fail.” And drawing aside the end
of her <span class='it'>mantilla</span>, she disclosed the hilt of a long,
keen dagger. She drew it forth, ran her finger
along its edge, smiled faintly, and replaced it in its
sheath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said Harding, turning away, “I
am warned at all events, and will take care that the
count is enlightened, also. I must speed upon my
mission. Good morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made no reply, and he passed out, taking his
way toward the <span class='it'>hacienda</span>, which lay in view, about
a mile distant. Turning to the right, he soon reached
the bank of the river, and followed its rapid but
even current, which ran sparkling beneath the court-yard
wall. It was yet quite early; and as he
reached the front of the mansion, his fear, that as yet
no one would be astir, was confirmed. Returning
again to the margin of the stream, he commenced
pacing up and down the sward under a row of elms,
with the intention of awaiting the rising of the
family. He had made but two or three turns, however,
and had halted, gazing about upon the still
morning scene, when he thought he observed something
like drapery pass across the arches in the wall,
through which the river entered the inclosure. He
advanced somewhat closer, and could distinctly see
a pair of small feet tripping across the river on a
footway made by placing large stones a step apart
from bank to bank. He could not doubt that it was
Margarita; but without going again to the front of
the house, he knew of no means of ingress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Casting his glance up and down the stream, to his
delight, he discovered a small boat moored to the
bank, and slowly swinging in the current. A moment
sufficed to untie the rope which bound it, and
in another, he was seated on its light planks, rapidly
floating toward the arched passage. The waters,
raised by the rains of the preceding day, left but
scanty room beneath the masonry; but lying down
in the bottom of the boat, and guiding her with his
hands, he soon had the satisfaction to emerge within
the inclosure. On rising again, he found himself
between an extensive garden on one side and the
offices of the mansion on the other. The former
seemed to be a neglected wilderness of trees, and
flowering plants and vines, but on reaching the footway
over which the feet had passed, he discovered
an opening to the labyrinth, in a broad, graveled
walk, which wound away between rows of shrubbery,
sparkling in the morning sunlight, and lost
itself in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning the boat broadside against the stones, to
prevent its floating away, he sprang to the bank and
walked rapidly down the avenue. He discovered
neither form nor sign of life for several minutes; but
as he turned from the main walk into a smaller,
which led away to the left, he saw directly before
him, walking slowly toward the place where he
stood, a young girl whose exquisite beauty well
justified his eagerness. She was slightly above the
medium height, slender, but well-proportioned, with
a carriage erect and graceful. Her rich, brown hair
was braided in masses over a forehead of the purest
white, and drawn back loosely so as almost to hang
upon her round, snowy neck. Her eyes were of the
same color with her hair—a rich, dark brown; and
their expression, though somewhat pensive, was yet
sparkling and clear. A nose of the true Grecian
model, a round, though not full chin, a small mouth
with thin, curling lips, and cheeks now tinged by
exercise in the cool morning air, completed a face
which might well have attracted a man of less taste
than the Count De Marsiac. To complete the picture,
she had small, beautiful feet, such as a sultana
might have envied; and her perfect, white hands,
which now lay folded together in front, might have
been a model for a sculptor. She wore a thin morning
dress of the purest white, and as she walked
slowly and unconsciously, it waved like gossamer
about her person—revealing, perhaps, too much of its
contour to please our northern prejudices, but still
adding to its exquisite attraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harding’s circumstances were so peculiar, that he
was embarrassed for a moment, and could not determine
how to meet her. She had not yet seen
him, and acting upon the impulse of perplexity, he
stepped within the cover of the shrubbery, and allowed
her to pass without speaking. She went but
a few steps, however, before he called—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Margarita!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started at his voice, but turned and at once
advanced to meet him. Her eyes sparkled with
pleasure, too, as she did so, and the hand she extended
to him trembled from emotion. Harding
could not know her feelings, and he had reason to
doubt her truth; but, though he could not tell what
it was, there was something in her look and manner
as she met him which made him forget all suspicion.
He took her hand in one of his, and placing the other
about her waist, drew her to him, and—the love of
a former time was renewed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We meet once more,” he whispered; it was all
he could say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feared we were parted forever,” she said, disengaging
herself from his embrace, but still leaning
on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you had forgotten me,” continued
Harding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not sure but I ought to have done so,” she
replied, with a smile which revealed how little she
meant what she said. “But how is it that you are
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had forgotten,” answered he; “I am here as
an envoy from another, to ask your hand in marriage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You!” she exclaimed, drawing away from him.
“From whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From his highness,” answered Harding, laughingly
detaining her, “Eugene Raoul, Count De
Marsiac!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gazed at him in surprise for a few moments;
and then, catching the light of his smile, folded her
hands upon his shoulder, looked archly into his eyes
and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the envoy does not deem my hand a prize
high enough to justify his preferring a claim on his
own behalf. I must even listen to the overtures of
his sovereign.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must deliver my credentials,” said Harding,
and drawing her to him, he kissed her upon
both cheeks. “And now,” he continued, taking
her hand, “my mission is ended; and in my own
proper character I claim this hand as my own. Is it
mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forever,” she answered, and he was about to
resume his “credentials,” when a rustling among
the bushes attracted his attention; and before Margarita
could disengage herself, Lieutenant Grant
confronted them, and leveled a pistol at Harding’s
breast!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Traitor!” he shouted furiously; “you shall pay
for this with your life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margarita screamed loudly, and threw herself in
front of her lover; but before Grant was aware of his
intention, Harding drew his sword, and passing
around her, threw himself upon him. He knocked
the pistol into the air just as it exploded; and the
next instant Grant was stretched upon the sward,
bleeding profusely from a wound in the head given
by the back of Harding’s sword! The latter drew
the remaining pistol from the sash of the fallen lieutenant,
and kneeling beside him raised him from the
ground on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring some water from the river,” he said to
Margarita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he looked up, he perceived that the party
had been increased by one! A tall, handsome woman,
of perhaps thirty-six, stood gazing sternly on
the scene, while Margarita shrank back abashed.
She had a face once evidently distinguished for its
proud beauty, but now remarkable chiefly for the
masculine strength of its expression. Her eye was
of that deep blue, which oftener indicates coldness
than tenderness; and her lips, now compressed and
white, were full of fierce resolution. It was plain
that a sneer was more natural to her than a smile,
anger than affection. Her brow was high but narrow,
and her nose a thin aquiline. It was not at all
strange that she had been the dominant spirit in
Colonel Eltorena’s household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this?” she commenced, in a voice of
powerful compass, but no sweetness. “And who
are you, sir, who dare to invade my private garden
to brawl with my guests?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know me full well, madam,” said Harding,
irritated by her tone, “and I intend that you shall
know me better. But this is no time to instruct
you. Margarita, will you bring some water from
the river?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margarita looked doubtfully at her mother; but at
a wave of her hand, ran away toward the river. As
she disappeared, her mother advanced closer to
Harding, who was endeavoring to resuscitate Grant,
and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are here, I suppose, sir, for the purpose of
attempting to interfere with my domestic arrangements;
but let me assure you that you shall hang to
one of these trees rather than be even admitted
within the house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your threats are brave enough, at all events,”
said Harding, with a smile. “But do you not think
it would better become a woman to assist me in a
duty of humanity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does she know of humanity?” demanded
a sharp female voice, close to the group; and on
turning his head Harding saw the same woman,
whose story of deception and betrayal had so much
interested him two hours before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do <span class='it'>you</span> here?” demanded the señora,
with one of those scowling looks for which her face
seemed made. “Must I have you, too, thrust from
my gate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Your</span> gate!” hissed the woman, advancing
nearer to the object of her hatred, and flashing insane
glances from those wild, haggard eyes. “<span class='it'>Your</span>
gate! Impostor, witch, begone! Must <span class='it'>I</span> have <span class='it'>you</span>
thrust from <span class='it'>my</span> gate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is something very appalling in the glance of
an eye touched with insanity; and the Englishwoman
shrunk from it, if not in fear, at least in dread.
But, at the same moment, she saw Margarita returning
with the water, and called to her—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go back, my daughter, and send some of the men
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To thrust me forth from <span class='it'>your gate</span>, I suppose,”
said the woman, advancing still closer, and fumbling
with her right hand under the end of her mantilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the señora fiercely; “will you go
without violence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” the maniac almost screamed. “<span class='it'>No!</span>” she
repeated; and with the word, she suddenly drew
her hand from its concealment, flourishing the dagger
which she had shown Harding, and with a bound
like that of a tiger, sprang upon her enemy and
buried the steel in her heart! Harding dropped
Grant, and rushed forward to prevent another blow,
but his interference was too late! The señora
screamed wildly, and with a convulsive gasp fell to
the ground, quite dead!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harding seized the arm of the murderess and easily
wrested the dagger from her hand. Indeed, she
made no resistance—the reaction of her excitement
sapped away her strength; and, submitting without
a word to all that Harding did, she seemed intent
only upon the now fast stiffening corpse which lay before
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry for her,” she murmured; “I am
sorry for her—but she would have it, and I cannot
bring her to life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She burst into tears, and threw herself to the
ground—uttering the most terrible imprecations of
God’s vengeance upon herself, mingled with curses
of the late Colonel Eltorena, and incoherent references
to his perfidy. Harding was at a loss how to
act—so strangely embarrassing was the wild scene
in which he found himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was soon decided for him. He
heard the approach of several armed men, walking
with quick steps along the path, and, the next moment,
Count De Marsiac suddenly entered the little
area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Villain!” he exclaimed, striding toward Harding;
“you have deceived me, and shall die the
death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back, sir!” shouted the lieutenant fiercely, presenting
the point of his sword. “If there is a greater
villain than yourself here, the devil must be present
in person!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count recoiled from the blade, and furiously
ordered his men to fire upon the audacious American;
but two of them, who had been busied with Grant,
now sprang upon him from behind, and, after a sharp
struggle, overpowered and bound him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will dispose of you after awhile,” said De Marsiac,
when he saw him <span class='it'>hors du combat</span>. “Leave
him where he is,” he added to his men; and proceeding
to give his orders with clearness and rapidity,
the scene was soon broken up. Grant was
restored to consciousness and again made a prisoner;
the body of the señora was removed by the women
summoned for the purpose, the murderess was taken
into custody, and the whole party repaired to the
house. Of this, De Marsiac at once took possession
as if he were already its master; Margarita was confined
to her own chamber, and Harding was thrust
into a small, dingy room, and left alone, with those
unpleasant companions, his own thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wanted yet an hour of noon, when, excepting
the occasional clash of arms in the court-yard,
where De Marsiac had quartered his men, all sounds
in the mansion ceased. The room in which Harding
found himself imprisoned, had but one small
window, and this was protected by strong, vertical
iron bars, in the fashion of the country. The only
door opened upon a corridor, along the stone pavement
of which the prisoner could distinctly hear the
footsteps of a sentinel, approaching and receding, but
never quite going beyond earshot. As if to secure
him, beyond the possibility of escape, another armed
man passed, from time to time, before the window,
looking curiously in at each return, and never disappearing
for more than five minutes. Harding, as the
reader has perceived, was a decidedly brave man;
but when he reflected upon the meaning of these
precautions, and the character of the man into whose
power he had fallen, he could not avoid some apprehension
as to his fate. Fatigue, however, soon
overcame his fears, and the drowsy monotony of
noonday conquered his wakefulness. Seating himself
in the deep window, he leaned his head against
the bars and slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he awoke, the sun was declining toward
the horizon, and the shadows of the trees were
lengthening along the hills. He aroused himself and
looked about him. His window commanded a view
of the garden, in which he had met Margarita, and a
part of the river, along which he had entered. The
waters had subsided since morning, and the arches
under the wall were proportionably more open; but
escape in this direction, even had he been able to
break his prison, was cut off by two sentinels who
stood upon the river-bank, and never, for a moment,
turned their eyes from his window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None but those who are deprived of it, can fully
appreciate the blessing of freedom; but even their
hopelessness may be deepened, by the view of waving
fields and clear sunlight, when they feel that it
is not for them that they wave and shine. Harding
turned away from the window, sick at heart, and
with rapid and impatient strides paced up and down
the narrow floor. As he passed the door for the
fourth or fifth time, he heard voices without, as if in
altercation, and the next moment, a heavy step coming
along the corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want here?” roughly demanded
a voice, which Harding at once recognized as that
of the count.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was taking the <span class='it'>Americano</span> something to eat,”
timidly answered the smaller of the voices, before
in altercation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him pass,” the count ordered the sentinel;
and then added, aloud, as if on purpose to be heard
within, “and tell the <span class='it'>Americano</span> that he had better
eat heartily, for it will be his last meal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, señor</span>,” said the boy, and at the same moment
the door was cautiously opened, so as to preclude
all chance of escape, and the <span class='it'>peon</span> entered,
bearing a small waiter, on which were placed some
articles of food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harding turned away, in no mood for eating—though
he had tasted nothing since morning. He
had heard De Marsiac’s threat, and the character of
his enemy left him little reason to doubt that he
would put it into execution. He had hoped that his
messenger would return from Anelo in time to save
him; but now all prospect of that seemed cut off;
for he knew that the count was not a man to delay
when he had once taken his resolution. As this
thought flashed across his mind, he wheeled suddenly
round, determined to rush forth and try the
chances of a fight; but before he could do so, the
door was drawn violently to, and hastily bolted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>señor</span> will eat something?” said the boy,
timidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set it down, then, and begone!” answered the
prisoner, pointing to a wooden bench at the side of
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The count told me to say you had better eat
heartily,” said the <span class='it'>peon</span>, “as this will be your last
meal; and,” he continued, in a lower voice, pointing
to a roll of bread, “you must break this bread, even
if you don’t eat it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gesture and tone attracted Harding’s attention.
He approached the bench and raised the roll,
while the boy, repeating his injunction, went back
to the door, and was cautiously let out. The lieutenant
waited until the bolts were drawn again, and
then broke the bread. A small slip of paper fell to
the floor; and, on raising it, he found the following
hopeful, though unsatisfactory words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Will you pay me the twenty dollars, or shall I
keep the horse?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be cheaper,” muttered Harding, perversely,
“to let him keep the horse, if he has ridden
him thirty leagues already. But,” he added, a suspicion
flashing across his mind, “that is impossible!
I ought to have known the young scoundrel would betray
me—and this is only a cruel <span class='it'>ruse</span> of De Marsiac!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned the paper over as he spoke, and his eye
caught these words written on the reverse:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I will be with you by 9 o’clock—McCulloch.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did the boy injustice,” was his first thought;
“he shall have both the money and the horse.”
And seating himself on the bench, he followed the
count’s well-meant advice, and was soon refreshed
by a hearty meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is wonderful how much the state of the stomach
has to do with the moods of the mind. Indeed, the
two organs seem to be inter-reactive; and I believe
some physiologists now contend, with great plausibility,
too, that the brain is really the digestive
organ. If this theory be true, mental distress
must be only another name for <span class='it'>dispepsia</span>; and—though
I have seen men who ate like anacondas,
when under great affliction—I am strongly inclined
to endorse the speculation. At all events, Harding
was “a case, or subject, in point;” for, but a few
minutes before, when he was apprehending many
certain and uncertain evils, from the resentment of
the count, he had not the least desire for refreshment;
but, on the first glimpse of hope, he had an
appetite like a soldier escaped from a beleaguered
city. And, no sooner was the inner man replenished,
than—on the aforesaid principle of inter-reaction—his
spirits rose almost to the point of absolute content.
Most axioms are tautological; but none is
more so than that which asserts that “man is a
<span class='it'>strange animal</span>.” The word “strange” might be
advantageously and conveniently left out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So thoroughly had the important act of receiving
his rations reinvigorated the captive, both corporeally
and mentally, that, when he resumed his
walk up and down the floor, he dismissed all anxiety
about his own fate, and began to speculate in reference
to the condition of his fellow-prisoner,
Grant. From regret that he had been compelled to
strike him, his mind wandered to a more pleasing
subject of contemplation—he began to long for some
information about Margarita; how she was treated
by the ruffian count, and, more particularly—for
love is always egotistical—how she viewed <span class='it'>his</span>
captivity; and finally, whether she had not forgotten
her grief for her murdered mother, in devising
means of giving him his liberty. These, or such as
these, are often very pleasant fancies—the misfortune
is, that, in most cases, they are <span class='it'>only</span> fancies,
and are occasionally rather rudely dispelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was, at all events, with Harding; for, just
as he had reached that supreme apex of egotism, to
which lovers so easily attain—where one’s mistress
is not supposed to know that there is any thing, or
anybody else in the world, about which, or whom,
she <span class='it'>can</span> think—when he was recalled to more substantial
realities, by hearing the count, in loud, stern
tones, giving a rapid and ominous command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Close the gates and bar them—muster the company,
with loaded muskets, and bring out the
prisoners!” Such was the significant order of a
man who was never known to stop at half-measures!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McCulloch will be too late, at last!” exclaimed
Harding, halting suddenly, and dashing his hand
violently against the wall. The dinner had lost its
virtues, for his heart sank even below its former
point of depression. And, in truth, his apprehension
was far from groundless. De Marsiac was incensed
beyond bearing, by the consciousness that
Harding had overreached him. His suspicions were
first aroused by observing him take a road to
<span class='it'>Piedritas</span>, different to the one he had pointed out.
He had watched him until he halted among the
elms, and had seen him dispatch the messenger for
assistance. He was ignorant, however, of his point
of destination—supposing that the nearest American
force was at Monclova, about sixty leagues<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> distant.
This supposition would give him at least
forty-eight hours, in which to prepare for the reception,
should soldiers be sent, or, at least, to retreat
into the mountains. The interview between Margarita
and Harding, had also been watched by some
one of the household; and when the count came in
great haste after his prisoner, this unwelcome news
had met him at the threshold. A man of his violent
temper could not have brooked this under any
circumstances, least of all, when he possessed, as
did the count, ample and ready means of vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the unfortunate prisoner was running these
comfortless circumstances over in his mind, the door
was suddenly thrown open, and several men rushed
upon him and threw him to the floor. Almost before
he was aware of their object, his arms were
drawn forcibly back and pinioned behind him.
They then lifted him to his feet, and unceremoniously
marched him out upon the corridor. Here he
found Grant, securely pinioned like himself, and
held by two <span class='it'>rancheros</span>, one on each arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a pretty predicament you have brought
us into,” said the younger, sullenly; “We’re to be
shot, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very probably,” answered Harding, scarcely
able to resist, even in that serious moment, an inclination
to smile at Grant’s disconsolate look.
“But how came you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I escaped from <span class='it'>Embocadura</span> about the same
time with you, and was in the garden to learn your
treachery and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to get that blow on the head,” interrupted
Harding, feeling again an impulse to jest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll settle that score with you hereafter,” said
Grant, his eyes flashing fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By ‘hereafter,’ I suppose, you mean in the next
world,” said Harding, with a bitter smile. “But,
seriously, Grant, this is no time for the indulgence
of such feelings; we have probably not long to live,
and ought to be thinking of more important matters.
I am heartily sorry for the blow, as well as for my
insincerity—will you forgive it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all my heart,” answered the other warmly;
and each made a gesture, as if to join hands; but
the cords bound them too closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can do but one thing, Grant,” said Harding,
with feeling, “and that is, die like Christian men—and
brave men,” he added, after a pause; “for these
cursed <span class='it'>rancheros</span> ought not to see any weakness in
Americans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They shall see none in me,” said Grant, firmly,
“though I do think it hard to be sacrificed in this
way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the chances of war, Grant—only one of
the chances of war,” said Harding, sturdily; and,
at the same moment the count, for whom the men
seemed to have been waiting, appeared on the corridor
and waved his hand. The files turned away
with their prisoners, and marching around the
building, soon gained the bank of the river. Here
they halted again, awaiting the approach of the
count, who, like most men when assuming a fearful
responsibility, seemed to act with much less than
his usual prompt rapidity. The sun had already
set, and there was only left the short twilight of
that latitude before the falling of night, which must
suspend the bloody act, perhaps forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a few minutes were lost, however, when De
Marsiac came hastily round the building, accompanied
by ten of his <span class='it'>rancheros</span> with trailed arms.
At a gesture from him the prisoners’ guards resumed
their march, and crossing the river on the
stepping-stones, before mentioned, soon gained the
little open space where Harding had met Margarita.
Selecting two trees which stood near each
other, the count ordered his captives to be lashed
securely to them; and then drawing his men some
five paces off, gave the preliminary commands to a
cold-blooded murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep a strong heart, Grant,” said Harding,
endeavoring to sustain his younger comrade in the
awful hour. “Don’t let your courage fail now—it
is too late!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a mere assassination,” said Grant,
grinding his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will be speedily avenged,” added Harding,
“more speedily than the vindictive scoundrel now
thinks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Marsiac caught these words, and paused.
For a moment he seemed to hesitate whether to
proceed. But his nature was too obstinate to
admit more than a passing thought of change in his
purpose; and without further noting the words of
Harding, he resumed his attitude of command.
While he seemed to hesitate, his men had brought
their guns to the ground—and they were now to be
brought up again by the successive movements of
the manual. The delay arising from this cause,
probably saved the lives of both the prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quick, light footstep was heard rapidly approaching
along the main walk, and a moment afterward,
Margarita, accompanied by one of her women,
rushed into the area and threw herself, without
hesitation, between the prisoners and their executioners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Count!” she exclaimed, her eyes flashing fire,
and her voice attesting the extremity of her emotion,
“is this the way you keep your promises with
one to whose hand you aspire! Down with your
arms, miscreants, and begone! <span class='it'>I</span> am mistress here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight sneer curled the haughty lip of the count;
but, considering his vengeance snatched from him
for the present, he gave his men the order to ground
their arms, but to stand firm. Assuming, then, the
most insinuating address in his power—and he was
far from ungraceful—he approached the incensed
girl, and drew her aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Margarita,” said he, taking her hand, “you
must pardon an act which is prompted only by love
for yourself; and you must not judge too harshly
of one who feels that the dearest price of earth has
been unfairly snatched from his grasp. Both these
men have been instrumental in blasting my hopes
of obtaining this hand; I feel that while they live, I
can never rebuild the vision I have indulged—perhaps
their death may not assist me—but,” and he
raised himself suddenly to his full height, and spoke
in a deep, determined tone, the meaning of which
she knew too well, “I shall at least be avenged!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” she asked, trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” he replied, calmly, “that since my
hopes are wrecked at any rate, their death will give
me revenge, without harm to my interests—<span class='it'>they
must die!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And dare you think that I would marry one
whose hands were bloody with such a deed?” she
asked, proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to me,” said he, laying his hand on her
arm; “my hands are not <span class='it'>now</span> bloody—yet you reject
me. If I spare these men, you will reject me
still—and I shall lose my revenge, and not gain
your love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps—” she commenced, but paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will be mine,” he interrupted, perceiving
that the moment had arrived, “both these men shall
be sent back, unharmed, to the American army—and
I shall be not only the happiest of men, for the requital
of my love, but will also be saved, what I
feel would be a great crime!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you know it to be a great crime, why commit
it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Margarita! you little understand man’s
feelings. But come,” he added, suddenly, “time
presses—I cannot wait. You reject me—they
must die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned away as he spoke, as if to resume his
commands; but Margarita called him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I consent,” she commenced, with hesitation,
“when will you demand the fulfillment of my
promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>To-night</span>,” he replied; “so soon as Father
Aneres can be brought from <span class='it'>La Embocadura</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why such haste?” she demanded. “Will not
to-morrow be quite soon enough? Remember, my
mother was only buried to-day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few hours can make no difference in that
matter,” he replied, “but <span class='it'>might</span> in another view. I
must have your hand <span class='it'>to-night</span>, or these men must
die <span class='it'>now</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a terrible alternative. But Margarita had
seen Harding’s messenger, and knew that McCulloch,
with his Rangers, might be expected within
three hours. The only question was, whether she
could find excuses enough to delay the ceremony
for that length of time. Could she do so, she was
safe; but—and it was a terrible thought—should De
Marsiac use his power to hasten it, she was lost!
But, running over in her mind all the plausible
reasons she might give for an hour’s delay, and
especially reflecting upon the consequences of a
refusal, she at length determined to consent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do no more,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I understand you to consent?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” she replied, “on the condition that you
send these unfortunate men to their army immediately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as you are mine, they shall set out,”
said the count; and Margarita was obliged to be
satisfied with his pledge. He at once ordered the
prisoners unbound, and taken back to their temporary
prisons; and walking beside his intended bride, he
followed the little procession to the house, and at
once gave orders to summon the priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The presence of a clerical functionary, in the
house of such a man as De Marsiac, was not so remarkable
as at first view it would seem; for, independent
of the almost complete degradation of that
order in that part of Mexico, there was another
reason for the opportune appearance of one of its
members. The count, anticipating the possibility
of gaining some advantage in the events about to
happen, had manifested one of the most valuable
characteristics of a great general—preparing himself
to make the utmost of whatever success might be
given him. He had summoned Father Aneres to
Embocadura, for the very purpose for which he
now called him to Piedritas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>padre</span> exhibited the three peculiarities of the
priesthood in that country, excepting, indeed, well-shaped
hands and feet, they were the only remarkable
points about him: he possessed a rotund corporation,
a full nether lip, and a small, twinkling,
black eye. He was above the ordinary level referred
to, however, for the grossness of his aspect
was rather that of easy self-indulgence, than of
positive sensuality. Indolence filled up the space in
him, which, in his brethren, it usually shared with a
cruel and rapacious depravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He entered the <span class='it'>hacienda</span> within an hour after the
dispatch of De Marsiac’s messenger—a promptitude
for which he received from none there, excepting
the count, any of the good wishes usually bestowed
upon such occasions on men of his profession. To
Margarita, especially, his coming was unwelcome
in a very high degree; for, though but an hour remained
before the period fixed for McCulloch’s
arrival with his Rangers, this was space enough for
one so determined as the count, and far too much
for her to dispose of in specious delays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was soon manifested, indeed, by the unannounced
entrance of De Marsiac, who demanded
that the ceremony should proceed forthwith. She
informed him that she had but now commenced her
preparations; and rashly said, that she would be
quite ready at the end of an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See that you are so, then,” said he, peremptorily;
“for I will not be cajoled into another minute’s
delay. I shall be here again precisely at nine
o’clock; and if you are not ready then, I shall shoot
the prisoners, and compel you to redeem your pledge
afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was about to make an angry reply; but, reflecting
that he was fully capable, if incensed more
than he seemed already, of dragging her at once to
the altar, she suppressed her indignation, and replied
as calmly as possible—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not think, count,” said she, “that such
language is unbecoming at such a time—and to
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If,” said he, softening at once, approaching her
and taking her hand, “if you treated me with the
confidence which I feel I deserve, no one could be
more gentle and affectionate than I would be. But
you leave no room for gentleness. Even now, you
are endeavoring to gain time in order that you may
be rescued by American soldiers. But—be at once
undeceived—these soldiers cannot arrive here sooner
than the day after to-morrow, and then they will find
the place vacant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margarita’s heart sank within her, though she had
seen Harding’s messenger, and trusted his report.
She knew not to what expedient one so adroit as her
persecutor might resort, to delay the march of the rangers,
or lead them astray; and her imagination at
once conjured up twenty plans by which he might
secure his object. She made no reply, however,
other than to assert that he was mistaken in her motives,
and request that he would leave her to her
preparations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said he, “I will return at nine
o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as his step ceased to be heard, Margarita
summoned the two confidential women who were
most about her person, and a council was held upon
the ways or means of escaping or gaining time.
But, fertile as is woman’s wit, no feasible plan was
suggested. Escape from the house was impossible,
for the count had every avenue guarded; the priest
was inaccessible, for he was completely under De
Marsiac’s influence; even her own men could not
be depended upon, for the few who were in the <span class='it'>hacienda</span>
were overawed by the <span class='it'>rancheros</span> of her persecutor.
The only alternative was to stand obstinately
silent at the altar; and yet by this course, she
inevitably sacrificed two lives—one of them dearer
to her than her own. Her position was terribly embarrassing;
for, if she should refuse to consent until
her lover was murdered, she could not even then be
sure that the count would not force her to yield afterward;
making thus a bloody, and unavailing sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of their deliberations—if a hopeless
search after desperate expedients could be so called—a
light knock was heard at the door, and on being
opened, it admitted Harding’s trusty messenger,
Margarita’s half-brother. He paused at the threshold
and gazed about him. It was the first time he had
ever been admitted into the private apartments of a
place which he had been taught to consider his own,
and the gleam of his dark eye would have betrayed
his thoughts to any one less preoccupied than Margarita.
The expression soon faded away, however,
and without salutation he advanced to Margarita,
and abruptly asked—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you about to marry Count De Marsiac,
willingly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you ask?” Margarita inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to prevent it,” he replied calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you do so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By gaining time, till the <span class='it'>Texanos</span> come,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can do this,” said Margarita, eagerly,
“your reward shall even exceed your own expectations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My reward does not depend upon you,” he
coldly replied. “It is quite as much to my interest
to prevent the marriage, as it can be to yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can that be?” interposed one of the women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be explained hereafter,” the young
man replied. “If you will follow my directions the
marriage shall be prevented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you wish me to do?” asked Margarita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only to delay your preparations as long as you
can, and if the Texans do not arrive before the
hour—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine o’clock is the time,” interrupted Margarita,
“and it wants but half an hour of it, now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said the other, “but linger as long as
possible. Do not tempt the count to any violence;
when you can delay no longer, go to the altar, and
you will understand what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no alternative but to trust him; and
Margarita did so the more willingly, because he dictated
the only course she could see open to her—procrastination,
in the hope of relief. His motives
were plain enough, though she could not fathom them.
He claimed the <span class='it'>hacienda</span> as his own, but he knew
that if it once fell into the hands of a man, whose
grasp was as tenacious as that of the count, his title
would have but small chance of successful assertion,
and he was therefore interested in preventing his
union with Margarita.</p>

<hr class='tbk112'/>

<p class='pindent'>In the mean time, the good Padre Aneres was
seated in one of the southern wings of the <span class='it'>hacienda</span>,
recruiting his energies, after an exhausting journey
of two miles from <span class='it'>Embocadura</span>. The robes and appointments
of his clerical office were arranged with
a neatness which scarcely distinguished his personal
appearance; for he was about to celebrate a sacrament,
which he viewed as hardly less important
than the last unction administered to the dying—to
which, indeed, it furnished no indistinct parallel. Preparatory,
however, to the performance of the ceremony,
he was fortifying himself with a liberal
supply of delicate viands—that to which he applied
himself most frequently being a large silver bowl of
red Parras wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been thus agreeably occupied for half an
hour or more after his arrival, and having recovered
his breath, began to feel comfortable again, when a
hasty but timid knock was heard at the door. The
worthy <span class='it'>padre</span> pushed the bowl of wine a little farther
from him, hastily swallowed the morsel in his
mouth, and having settled himself in an attitude of
meditation, gave a gentle invitation to enter. The
door was pushed timidly open, and the young messenger
presented himself, in most singular plight.
His clothes were studiously disarranged; his hair
was disheveled, and covered with dust and ashes,
while his eyes gave signs of recent violent weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oh, padre!</span>” he exclaimed, in evident distress,
throwing himself at the good Father’s feet. “<span class='it'>Peccavi!
Peccavi!</span> I have sinned! I have sinned!
O, Father! Hear me, and forgive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The worthy priest was startled at this exhibition
of grief, so much more intense than he was accustomed
to see; for the penitent beat his breast, and
humbled himself upon his knees in the most abandoned
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Calm yourself, my son,” said the pastor, “and
remember that mercy may be extended to the guiltiest
of mortals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Confiteor! Confiteor!</span>” rapidly continued the
sinner. “Oh, <span class='it'>padre</span>! Pity and forgive! <span class='it'>Peccavi!
Peccavi! O, Miseracordia!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Entrust your sin to the Representative of Heaven,”
gently urged the Father, “and never despair
of God’s mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here! O, not here!” exclaimed the youth,
springing to his feet and rushing to the door.
“There are spies here—ears listening for the confession,
which must be given to you alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who dares to penetrate the secrets of the Confessional?”
demanded the <span class='it'>padre</span>, his little black eyes
twinkling with indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The count and his spies,” answered the youth.
“We must leave the house—we must go forth into
the night, for my soul is burthened with sin, and the
load must be lifted. Come!” He seized the confessor
by the robe and dragged him toward the door,
sobbing “<span class='it'>Peccavi! Peccavi!</span>” all the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my son,” hesitated the priest, “the count
is—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come—come—come!” repeated the penitent,
impatiently; a part of his grief giving way before his
haste to be absolved. “We can return before you
will be wanted. I cannot endure to wait! O, pity
and forgive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good Father, like most indolent men, was
very slow of decision at all times; and now he was
carried away by the torrent of grief, and the impatience
for absolution, which seemed to flow from the
consciousness of some great crime. Half inclined to
refuse, and yet too undecided to act with promptness,
he suffered himself to be dragged from the
room, and through the door into the open air. Here
they were brought to a sudden halt: a <span class='it'>ranchero</span>
stepped before them, and presented his musket.
But such an indignity at once restored the Father to
his dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who dares to obstruct a son of the church in the
discharge of his duty to Heaven?” he indignantly
demanded. “Out of the way, false man of blood;
and let the confessor and his penitent pass out from
among the oppressors of God’s people!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This vigorous speech was not particularly appropriate
to the occasion, nor was it thoroughly understood
by him to whom it was addressed. Neither
was it such as was likely to move one of De Marsiac’s
ordinary followers; for the <span class='it'>rancheros</span> generally
stood more in awe of their leader’s displeasure,
than of the wrath of Heaven; and it is probable that
but few of the desperadoes would have hesitated
to bayonet the Pope, himself, had the count so
commanded. But this sentinel seemed to be of a
more reverential nature; for no sooner did he recognize
the priest and his companion, than he raised the
point of his bayonet, shouldered his musket, and allowed
them to pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This disobedience of his captain’s orders—remarkable
for its want of precedent among De Marsiac’s
banditti; was not the only singular circumstance
about the accommodating sentinel, as the reader will
soon observe. The young penitent disappeared
among the shades of night with his confessor, whom
he hurried on faster, probably, than he had ever
walked before. He directed his course to a little
group of <span class='it'>ranchos</span>, which stood directly south of the
<span class='it'>hacienda</span>. Having entered one of these, and remained
five minutes—it seemed that his sin was not
long in the confessing or absolution, notwithstanding
his overwhelming distress—for at the end of that
time he issued forth <span class='it'>alone</span>, with a well-pleased smile
upon his lip, and elasticity restored to his bearing.
From the door of the <span class='it'>rancho</span> he took his way north-ward
again; verging obliquely to the right, however,
until he reached the bank of the river, nearly
a quarter of a mile east of the <span class='it'>hacienda</span>. At this
point, a grove of small trees sheltered the bank, and
through them passed the road up the valley to
Anelo. The youth paused as he gained the shadows,
and gave a low, clear whistle. It was answered
from the river-bank; and in a moment afterward,
a man emerged from the covert, and approached
the messenger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A whispered consultation ensued between the
pair, but of brief duration; for Eltorena seemed in
haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep due south,” said he, as he prepared to return,
“until you reach Martiniez’ avenue—then turn
west, until you are opposite the south entrance, and
approach cautiously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With those words he turned away; and retracing
his steps with great rapidity, soon came in view of
the sentinel, who had permitted him to pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Quien va la?</span>” hailed the latter, presenting his
musket. But Eltorena only answered by a low
whistle, and boldly advanced. As he approached,
the sentinel again shouldered his piece, and a consultation
ensued between <span class='it'>them</span>, also—the youth
pointing out the direction which he had indicated to
his confederate at the river, and then passing into
the mansion. The sentinel resumed his pace up and
down his post—pausing from time to time with his
ear bent toward the east, as if waiting for some expected
sound. But every thing was as still as a
summer night in the north; and though the moon
was now rising over the eastern hills, there was not
a moving thing perceptible to the eye.</p>

<hr class='tbk113'/>

<p class='pindent'>While these things were going on without, the
hour appointed for the ceremony of marriage was
fast approaching; and one of the parties, at least,
was filled with anxious fears. Margarita had delayed
her preparations as much as possible; but the
assistance of her women, with which it would have
been more politic to have dispensed, had, even against
her will, so expedited them, that she was fully
ready at the time. Nor, had it been otherwise, was
the count disposed to permit any further procrastination;
for, punctually to the minute, he knocked at
her door, and, without waiting a summons to enter,
threw it open and stepped across the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad to see you ready,” said he, throwing
as much kindness into his manner as his consciousness
of wrong permitted. “Come, the chapel is
prepared, and the <span class='it'>padre</span> awaits us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Count,” said the intended bride, trembling with
apprehension, but anxious to make another effort
for delay, “cannot this ceremony be as well performed
to-morrow? I do not like this indecent
haste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be performed to-night—<span class='it'>now</span>,” he replied
calmly. “If you refuse, you know the alternative.
I will not be trifled with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not trifling with you, indeed,” said she hurriedly.
“But reflect—my mother is scarcely cold in
her grave!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The better reason why you should observe her
wishes,” De Marsiac replied. “I have considered
all that, and find no reason to change my mind. If
you intend to redeem your pledge at all, it is as well
to-night as to-morrow. If <a id='you'></a>you are willing to sacrifice
your friends, <span class='it'>los Americanos</span>, your refusal to-night
will only give me my revenge sooner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His course of argument was too direct and forcible
to be oppugned; Margarita rose as its meaning
reached her, and signified her willingness to go at
once to the altar. The count turned to one of his
followers and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to Father Aneres, and tell him that we will
be ready by the time he can reach the altar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man approached the door of the room where
we have seen the good <span class='it'>padre</span> recruiting his exhausted
strength. He was met at the door by young
Eltorena, dressed in a white cassock, and holding a
censer in his hand, as if in attendance upon the
priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good Father,” said the young man, “is in
his closet, but will meet them in the chapel in five
minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man returned to his master, and the procession
at once marched toward the chapel. A room
fitted up for this purpose is to be found in almost all
the larger <span class='it'>haciendas</span> of that part of Mexico—its size
and splendor depending upon the wealth and piety
of the proprietor. That at <span class='it'>Piedritas</span> had been somewhat
neglected of late, but was still a respectable
chapel. It was separated from the priest’s room—where
Eltorena had sought the <span class='it'>padre</span>—by two partitions,
between which was the private closet; and
leading out of this was a door which opened behind
the altar. It was through this door that Father
Aneres was to enter for the performance of the momentous
ceremony. But the reader already knows
that the good Father was not within, and therefore
could not come forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The procession entered the chapel in the following
order. The count, holding the unwilling hand
of his trembling bride, was succeeded by the two
women, accompanied by his trusty lieutenant, who
was to “give the bride away.” Then came three
files of <span class='it'>rancheros</span> with trailed arms—a desecration
which the good Father, timid as he was, would not
have permitted. Behind these, each between two
soldiers, who jealously watched them, came Harding
and Grant—borne in the procession, like the
prisoners of ancient Rome, to grace the triumph of
the conqueror! Then followed the remainder of the
count’s band of free-companions, numbering, in all,
about twenty. All the domestics of the family
crowded in after, and the door was taken in charge
by the trusty sentinel who had disobeyed his
orders!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count dragged his bride to the chancel-rail,
and, leaving her there for a few moments supported
by her women, took upon himself the duties of master
of the ceremonies. He placed his two prisoners
directly behind the bride, well guarded however, so
that they would have the satisfaction of seeing
without the power of interfering. Behind them he
ranged his followers in a compact mass, and directing
the <span class='it'>peons</span> to seat themselves in the rear, he
ordered the sentinel to close the door, but not to
leave it. Returning then to the chancel-railing, he
resumed his place beside Margarita, and took her
cold and trembling hand in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although these dispositions consumed full ten
minutes, when he returned to his place, the priest
still delayed his coming. The count, however, fiery
and impetuous as he was, waited patiently for a
period quite as long; when, finding that the door still
remained closed, he began to knit his brows and
mutter angry threats. These signs encouraged Margarita,
for they indicated delay, if not deliverance;
and she had even the audacity to smile in De Marsiac’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Antonio,” said the latter furiously, “go to Father
Aneres and tell him that we are waiting for him—<span class='it'>impatiently</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man addressed sprang to the door and attempted
to open it, but it did not yield to his efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is fastened on the outside,” he said. But, at
the same moment, the door behind the altar was
heard to swing upon its hinges, and a slow, heavy
step was placed upon the short stairway which led
up to the platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old dotard is coming at last,” muttered the
count, not observing the ominous report of his messenger.
He laid aside his gold-laced cap, which
hitherto he had kept upon his head, and resuming
Margarita’s hand, placed himself before the railing
and looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not the priest who stood at the altar! A
tall, heavily-armed man—evidently an American—rose
suddenly from his cover, and, leveling a pistol
at De Maniac’s breast, gave his war-cry of “<span class='it'>Texano!
Texano!</span>” At the same moment the closed
door was thrown open, and a band of near twenty
men filed speedily in and brought their carbines to
bear upon the <span class='it'>rancheros</span>—while a detachment,
equally strong, rushed in from the priest’s room, and
marched past their leader—who was none other than
McCulloch of the Texan Rangers! A glance passed
between Harding and Grant—each understood the
thought of the other—and, as if by pre-concert, they
broke away from their guards, sprang upon the
count, and, before his men could interfere, dragged
him, a prisoner in his turn, within the chancel!
Scarcely giving him time to speak, two of the rangers
hurried him away through the priest’s room,
and delivered him in charge to the guard stationed
at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lay down your arms!” shouted McCulloch,
through the din which now arose—chiefly from the
domestics—“and every man’s life shall be spared.
But the <span class='it'>ranchero</span> that holds his arms one minute,
shall hang to the first tree that’s tall enough to
stretch him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word “<span class='it'>Texano</span>” had already half accomplished
the conquest; the captivity of their leader
weakened their resolution, and this threat, which
every Texan was, in the estimation of a Mexican,
fully capable of executing, completed the discomfiture.
Each <span class='it'>ranchero</span> threw down his arms with an
alacrity which seemed to indicate that they were
growing hot in his hands, and the two detachments
of rangers marched in and made them all prisoners,
without the least resistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one good job well done, boys,” said
McCulloch, “and all the better done because we
have spilt no blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning then to Harding, who was supporting
Margarita upon his arm, while Grant stood moodily
aside, he said—cordially receiving the hand extended
to him—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were very nearly too late, at last—though,
thank God! not quite. I had information from your
messenger, since we entered the <span class='it'>hacienda</span>, that the
bandit, De Marsiac, designed to take your lives,
even after he had obtained the hand which was to be
their ransom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt not,” said Harding, frankly; “if my
friend Grant and I see to-morrow morning, we shall
owe the sight to your promptness in attending my
call. You must be satisfied with our gratitude until
the chances of war shall enable us to discharge the
obligation in kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the only mode of payment,” said the captain
with a smile, “is rescuing me from a scrape like
this, I hope you may never have a creditor more
pressing than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know,” said the ranger lieutenant, Gillespie,
coming forward with the open manner of the
soldier; “I think, if the prize, at the outcome, were
as great as it seems to be in this instance, Captain
McCulloch would have no special objection to dangers
quite as imminent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Margarita as he spoke—for she still
hung upon Harding’s arm. The captain laughed at
what he considered a compliment both to himself and
the lady; a round of introductions ensued, and congratulations,
with jests and pleasant laughs—during
which the prisoners were marched off and confined,
and the <span class='it'>hacienda</span> reassumed its aspect of dreamy
quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” said Margarita, when a pause at
last broke the round of felicitations, “you have ridden
far and hard, and must be both fatigued and
hungry. Will you not partake of some refreshment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the utmost pleasure,” answered McCulloch;
“but I must first see my men quartered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have already given orders for their accommodation,”
said Margarita. “Since I may soon be
under their escort, it becomes me to consult their
comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Under their escort!” exclaimed Harding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she replied. “Since my mother’s death
this is no longer a fit residence for me. I have many
relatives in Saltillo, and it is thither that I wish to
go. When you return to the United States,” she
added, in French, observing Harding’s doubtful look,
“I shall be your companion—if you desire it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could only reply by another look, of a different
meaning, when McCulloch asked—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will become of the <span class='it'>hacienda</span> in your absence?
I have seen too much of the steward system
in this country, not to regret the absence of the proprietor
from every fine estate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall give it to one,” she replied, “who,
though he already claims it unjustly, has, by his services
this night entitled himself to even a greater reward.
I mean the young man who led you hither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And his mother,” suggested one of the women,
who did not quite relish the generous proposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a confirmed maniac,” said Margarita with
a shudder, “and this is only a stronger reason why
I should do as I say. She will be a burthen upon her
son, and it is but just that he should have the means
of supporting her.” This closed the discussion, and
the party adjourned to supper.</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day the prisoners were mustered by
the order of McCulloch—as they supposed, for the purpose
of being treated as <span class='it'>their</span> countrymen had so often
treated <span class='it'>his</span>; that is, being hung like traitors, or shot
by platoons—but really for the purpose of being released.
De Marsiac, however, as a man who might
do the Americans some injury, was retained a prisoner
of war. All the rest, much to their surprise,
were dismissed with an <span class='it'>admonition</span> not to be found
again in arms. The captain judged, very correctly,
that taking their <span class='it'>parol</span> would be an unmeaning ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About an hour afterward, the cavalcade set out for
Saltillo, by way of Anelo and Capellania—a long
route which McCulloch’s orders compelled them to
take. Margarita, with a generosity which my
readers may be disposed to call romantic, but which
was, after all, scarcely more than justice—had conveyed
the <span class='it'>Hacienda de los Piedritas</span> to her half-brother,
who had so richly deserved his reward.
The sacrifice was small, too, for she had, still remaining,
possessions ample even for that country of
overgrown individual fortunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days brought them to the handsome city of
Saltillo, where Margarita found a refuge among her
many relatives. De Marsiac was reported at headquarters
and sent to the rear; while Harding and
Grant—wiser if not better men—rejoined their companies,
and resumed their duties. The events of
their captivity seemed to have cured the latter of the
pleasant malady which had afflicted him; and the
pair became, in a short time, as inseparable as ever.
They visited Margarita together, and though the
younger winced a little, when by any chance the
subject of his hallucination was referred to, on the
whole he bore his disappointment with a good grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle of Buena Vista closed the campaign in
that part of the country; and shortly afterward the
regiment to which they were attached was discharged.
Before their return home, however, the
ancient rivals returned to Saltillo—where, in the
handsome cathedral, Harding and Margarita were
united in marriage. And, a pleasant memento of
rather uncertain times, the officiating priest was the
worthy Father Aneres, who had figured in the history
of Harding and Grant while they were “<span class='it'>Captive
Rivals</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>With</span> all my heart, Graham! But inasmuch as
the lecture you want a copy of has never been reduced
to writing, though portions have appeared from
time to time in the newspapers of the day; and I
have no notes worth referring to, I dare not pretend
to give you the language I employ; for, between
ourselves, that depends upon the weather and the
House, to say nothing of my temper at the time.
For example; if I see before me a goodly proportion
of what are called the <span class='it'>learned</span>, or the <span class='it'>educated</span>,
I never mince matters—I never talk as if butter
wouldn’t melt in my mouth, but go to work with
my sleeves rolled up, as if I heard a trumpet in the
hollow sky. In other cases, where the great majority
of my hearers happen to be neither learned
nor educated—though there may be a sprinkling of
both—I am apt, I acknowledge, to wander off into
familiar every-day illustrations—perhaps into down-right
story-telling, or what my brethren of the bar
would be likely to denominate <span class='it'>unprofessional</span> rigmarole.
But the substance of my preaching for
many years upon this subject, and the “thing signified,”
and the general arrangement, under all sorts
of provocation, I think I may venture to promise you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bear in mind, I pray you, that phantoms under
one aspect, may be more terrible than giants, cased
in proof, under another. Every great mischief,
being once enthroned or established, is a host of itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the open field, lawyers are not easily vanquished—out-manœuvered
or overborne. Walled about, as
with a triple wall of fire—or <span class='it'>brass</span>?—high up and
afar off, their intrenchments are only to be carried
by storm. They must be grappled with, face to
face. No quarter must be granted—for no quarter
do they give—no mercy do they show, after their
banners are afield. “Up, guards! and at ’em!”
said Wellington, at the battle of Waterloo; and so
say I! whenever I see my brethren of the bar
rallying for a charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They will bear with me, I hope—as I have borne
with them for twenty-five years; for, while I complain
of their unreasonable ascendency throughout
our land, of their imperious, overbearing, unquestioned
domination, I acknowledge that, constituted
as we are—<span class='sc'>We</span>, the People—we cannot do without
them—and the more’s the pity. Law we must
have, and with it, as if by spontaneous generation—lawyers,
till Man himself undergoes a transformation,
and his very nature is changed. Both are necessary
evils—much like war, pestilence, and famine,
or lunatic-asylums, poor-houses, and penitentiaries;
or apothecaries’ shops, with their adulterous abominations;
and every other substitute for, and abridgment
of, human liberty, human happiness, the laws
of health, or the instinct of self-reliance. If men
will not do as they would be done by; if they will
not be “temperate in all things”—then they deserve
to be drugged, and blistered, and bled here by the
doctors, and there by the lawyers, till they have
come to their senses, or can no longer be dealt with
profitably by either; for, although every man, according
to the worthy Joe Miller, may be his own
washerwoman—at least in Ireland—it is very clear
that in this country, he might as well undertake to
be his own jailer, as his own lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would go further; for, like the illustrious Hungarian,
I desire to conciliate and satisfy, not the few
but the many; not only my brethren of the bar, but
everybody else worth satisfying; I would even admit—and
how could I well go further, and “hope to
be forgiven?”—that, in view of Man’s nature, as
developed by our social institutions, Law and
Lawyers both, may be, and sometimes are, under
special circumstances, not only a necessary evil,
but a very good thing. <span class='it'>There!</span> I have said it—and
let them make the most of it. I mean to admit all
I can—and much good may it do them! But then, I
would ask, if we may not have too much, even of a
good thing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hold that we may; and I appeal for proof to the
countless volumes of law which cannot be understood
by any but lawyers; nor by any two of them
alike, till every other word, perhaps, in a long paragraph
has been settled by adjudication—two or three
different ways—after solemn argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I appeal to what is called the administration of
justice, by jury-trial, in our courts of law, where
twelve ignorant, unreasoning men, got together, nobody
knows how—hit or miss—are held to be better
qualified—being bound by their oaths to think alike
in most cases, and to return a unanimous verdict,
whether or no—than Lord Chancellor Bacon himself,
or Chief Justice Marshall would be, to settle
any and every question, however new, and however
abstruse and complicated, upon every possible subject
that may happen to be brought before them for the
first time in all their lives! And this, without any
previous knowledge on their parts, or any other
preparation by the lawyers who are to enlighten
them, than may have been made the night before,
by “reading up,” or “stuffing” for the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I appeal, moreover, to the testimony of the sufferers
themselves—<span class='it'>parties</span>, they are technically
called—who, after being scorched, and sifted, and
harassed, and pillaged, under one pretence or another,
year after year, and within an inch of their
lives; or driven well-nigh distracted by the vicissitudes
and anxieties incident to every well-managed
law-suit, where “good pickings” are to be had, or
by that hope-deferred “which maketh the heart
sick,” begin to get their eyes opened, and to see for
themselves, and are sometime ready to acknowledge
for the help of others, who are elbowing their way
up—or down?—to <span class='it'>see</span> the elephant, that when they
pass over the threshold of those gambling-houses,
that are established by law, under the name of
Courts of Justice, and put up their stakes, they will
find three times out of four—perhaps nineteen times
out of twenty—that when the raffle comes off at last—with
the jury-box—it is to decide, not which of
the two parties litigant—plaintiffs or defendants—but
what third party—the lawyers—shall sweep the board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I might appeal to the swarming thousands of
our younger professional brethren, who, ashamed
to beg, afraid to steal, and too lazy to work, instead
of following the business of their fathers, taking their
places, and maintaining themselves honestly, give
way to a foolish mother, or sister, or to some greater
simpleton still more to be pitied, or to a most unhealthy
ambition—that of being an <span class='it'>Esquire</span>, and a
pauper, with very white hands, who, having studied
law, will have to be provided for at last by marriage,
or office; and with that view have literally taken
possession of our high places, our kneading-troughs
and our bed-chambers—after the fashion of their
predecessors in Egypt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nay, more—I am ready to acknowledge, and I
do for myself, my executors, administrators and
assigns—or publishers—hereby acknowledge, and I
hope with no unbecoming nor uncourteous qualification,
that, taken together, as a power, body, or
estate, the Lawyers of our land are to the full as
honest—and as trustworthy—by <span class='it'>nature</span>—as any
other power, body or estate among us, of equal
numbers, wealth, dignity, or intelligence; notwithstanding
the opinion so generally entertained,
and so often expressed, to their disadvantage, in
the plays and farces, or newspapers and story-books
of the day, (not always, nor altogether synonymous,
I hope;) but no honester, and no more trustworthy;
for, although I believe—and I mean just
what I say—that no <span class='it'>great advocate</span>, in the popular
sense of the words, can be an honest man, however
conscientious he may be out of court, or in
other business; and however anxious he and others
may be to distinguish between the Advocate and the
Man—as if a lawyer were allowed two consciences
to practice with, and two courts—one above and the
other below—to practice in; yet I believe that a
great Lawyer, or Jurist, like Sir Matthew Hale, or
Chief Justice Marshall, or Chancellor Kent, or any
one of a score that might be named, or Judge Parsons,
being translated to the bench, from the corrupting
influences and stifling atmosphere below,
may be a very honest man; just as I believe—and I
don’t care who knows it—that silver spoons and
watches left within striking distance of an attorney
at law—I am only supposing a case—may be safe,
“notwithstanding and nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By <span class='it'>nature</span>, I say, and not by education, habit, or
association at the bar. Away from the bar, I acknowledge
the integrity of my brethren as equal to
that of any other class whatever. And this being
admitted—what more would they have? Would
they claim to be honester and more trustworthy than
any other class, either by education or nature?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But observe; though ready to acknowledge their
honesty, by <span class='it'>nature</span>, as men; or rather, while I acknowledge
that they are, to the full, as honest as
other men are by <span class='it'>nature</span>—but no honester; and as
trustworthy in all other relations, apart from law—as
good but no better, I maintain that they are constantly
exposed to such disqualifying temptations,
and to such disastrous influences peculiar to their
profession; that they have established a code of
morals for themselves, as lawyers, which would not
be allowed to them as citizens; and which, if openly
avowed and persisted in, by brethren out of the profession,
would be sure to send them to the penitentiary;
that they have altogether too much power in
this country—a power out of all proportion to their
numbers, their talents, their intelligence, their virtues,
and their usefulness; and that, instead of being chosen
for lawgivers throughout our land, in a proportion
varying from three-fifths to nearly seven-eighths, in
all our legislative bodies, they are the very last persons
among us to be intrusted with the business of
legislation—having a direct personal interest in
multiplying our laws—in altering them—and in
making them unintelligible to all the rest of the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not satisfied with their pay, as legislators, for
making the law, varying from two to ten dollars
a-day—with washing and mending, where washing
and mending are possible—they require, as lawyers,
from twenty-five to one hundred dollars a-day for
telling, or rather for guessing what it means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what is the result? Just this. That a privileged
body, anointed for office and power, who, but
for the blindness and prodigal infatuation of the
People, would often be the nobodies of every productive
or efficient class, are enabled to fare sumptuously
every day, wear purple and fine linen—at
the expense of others—all their lives long; and to
carry off all the honors from every other class of the
community. Think of this, I pray you; and bear
with me, while I proceed with my demonstration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That they have learned to reverence themselves,
and all that belongs to them, I do not deny; but then,
if it is only themselves, and not the image of God—if
it is only what belongs to themselves and to their
estate, or craft, as lawyers, and not as Men, they
so reverence—in what particular do they differ from
other self-idolators?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are We, the People, to be concluded by their
very pretensions? Are We to be estopped by the
very deportment we complain of? Because they
are exacting and supercilious, and self-satisfied, and
arrogant, and overbearing, are we to be patient and
submissive? Are we to be told, if not in language,
at least by the bearing and behavior of these gentry,
that, inasmuch as all men may be supposed to
be best acquainted with themselves, therefore
Lawyers are to be taken by others at their own
valuation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let it be remembered that they who properly reverence
themselves, always reverence others. But
who ever heard of a Lawyer with any reverence—worth
mentioning—for anybody out of the profession?
This, to be sure, is very common with ignorant
and presumptuous men. It is the natural growth
of a narrow-minded, short-sighted, selfish bigotry.
A mountebank or a rope-dancer will betray the same
ridiculous self-complacency, if hard pushed. Were
you to speak of a great man—Kossuth, for example—in
the presence of a fiddler, who had never heard
of him before, he would probably crook his right
elbow, and cant his head to the left, as if preparing
to draw the long bow, or go through some of the motions
common to all the great men he had ever been
acquainted with, or heard of, or acknowledged, before
he questioned you further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would never enter his head that a truly great
man could be any thing but a fiddler; a Paganini
dethroned perhaps—like Peter the Great in a dockyard—or
that “any gentleman as was a gentleman,”
could ever so far forget himself in <span class='it'>his</span> company, as
to call a man great who was no fiddler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do they say of me in England?” said the
corpulent, half-naked savage that Mungo Park saw
stuffing for a cross-examination under a bamboo tree
in Africa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just so is it with our brethren of the bar. Law
being the “perfection of Reason,” and her seat “the
bosom of God,” they, of course, are the expounders
or interpreters of both; a priesthood from the beginning,
therefore, with the privilege and power of indefinite
self-multiplication. The sum and substance
of all they know, and all they care for under Heaven,
if they are greatly distinguished, being Law, what
else could be expected of them? If they are great
lawyers they are never any thing else—they are
never statesmen, they are never orators—they are
never writers. Carefully speaking, Daniel Webster
is not a great lawyer—nor is Henry Clay—nor was
Lord Brougham; but they were advocates, and orators
and statesmen. Sir James Scarlett and Denham
were great lawyers, before whose technical superiority
and sharp practice Lord Brougham quailed and
shriveled in the Court of King’s Bench. But when
they encountered each other in the House of Commons—what
a figure the two lawyers cut, to be sure,
in the presence of the thunderer! They were phantoms,
and he the Olympian Jove. William Pinkney
was a great lawyer; but for that very reason he was
out of place in the Senate chamber, and made no
figure there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even for this they have a justification—or a
plea in bar. The law is a “jealous mistress,” we
are told, and will endure no rival; a monarch “who
bears no brother near the throne.” And well do they
act upon this belief; and well do they teach it by
precept and by practice; for few indeed are they,
even among the foremost, who have gathered up, in
the course of a long life, any considerable amount of
miscellaneous knowledge, notwithstanding the reputation
they sometimes acquire, in a single day, by
their insolent questioning of learned, shy and modest
professional men, or experts, after they have once
got them caged and cornered, and tied up hand and
foot in a witness-box, and allowed to speak only
when they are spoken to; there to be badgered for
the amusement of people outside, more ignorant, if
possible, than the learned counsel themselves; but
incapable of seeing through the counterfeit, which,
while it makes them laugh, makes the “judicious
grieve;” and mistaking for cleverness and smartness
the blundering audacity of an ignorant and garrulous,
though privileged pretender, who does not know that
it often requires about as much knowledge of a subject
to propound a safe and proper question, as to
answer it: nor that the veriest blockhead may ask
twenty questions in a breath, which no mortal man
could ever answer, and would not even try to answer,
unless he were a still greater blockhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, having swept the stage fore and aft, and
secured, as I trust, a patient hearing from the profession,
let us go to work in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I maintain that among the popular delusions of the
day, there is no one more dangerous nor alarming
than that which leads our People to believe that they
constitute a republic and that they govern themselves,
merely because they are allowed to choose
their own masters; <span class='it'>provided</span> they choose them out
of a particular class—that of the lawyers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the opening of every great political campaign,
we hear a great deal about the privileged classes;
the ruffled-shirt and silk-stocking gentry: and sometimes
men prattle about the aristocracy of talent, or
the aristocracy of wealth—but who ever heard any
complaints of our legal aristocracy—an oligarchy
rather—for they make all the laws, they expound all
the laws, and they hold all the offices worth having—in
perpetuity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And whose fault is it? If the People are such
asses, why should they not be saddled and bridled,
and ridden in perpetuity? It is their nature. They
are prone to class-worship, and to family-worship—to
self-depreciation, and to a most incapacitating
jealousy of one another. Even in the day of the
elder Adams, it was found that the office of a justice
of the peace, like that of a legislator, was well-nigh
hereditary in New England. Having anointed the
father, how could they help anointing the son?—or
the daughter’s husband, if the father had no son?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, let us look at the consequences. From
Aristotle down to the last elementary writer on Government,
it has been every where, and at all times,
acknowledged, that every possible kind of sway
upon earth, between Despotism and Anarchy, may
be resolved into three elements of power, differently
combined, or combined in different proportions.
These elements are: 1. The Legislative, or law-making
power; 2. The Judicial, or law-expounding
power; and 3. The Executive, or law-enforcing
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taken together we have what is called the Sovereign
Power. The power of making laws, of saying
what they mean, and of carrying them into execution
being all that is ever needed for government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this, the Sovereign Power, may be concentrated
in one person, whence we have the Czar, the
Sultan, or the Autocrat; or it may be confined to a
few—as in Sparta, or Genoa, or Venice, or Poland—constituting
either an Aristocracy or an Oligarchy;
or it may be distributed among the people equally,
as at Rome or Athens at particular periods of their
history, when they were a tumultuous unmanageable
Democracy: or unequally, as in England, or in these
United States, thereby constituting a Limited Monarchy,
or a Representative Republic, pretending to a
balance, by the help of a King or President, a House
of Lords, or a Senate, and a House of Commons or
a House of Representatives, and a Judiciary, more
or less dependent upon the Executive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all these different systems the worst by far is
an Oligarchy—or the government of a privileged
few—no matter whether elective and shifting, or permanent,
provided that, as a body or estate, they are
allowed by common consent to make the laws—to expound
the laws—and to carry the laws into execution,
by holding all the offices worth having, from
that of the monarch or president, down to that of a
clerk or sergeant-at-arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True it is, that by no human contrivance can the
three elements of power above mentioned, be kept
entirely separate—for they will run into each other—as
where the Supreme Executive is allowed a
veto, or required to sanction a law: and where the
Senate, as a branch of the Supreme Legislative
power, intermeddles with the appointing power of
the Executive under the name of confirmation; and
where the Supreme Judiciary, after being appointed
by the Executive and confirmed by the Senate, are
made dependent upon that other branch of the Supreme
Legislative power for the payment of their
salaries—the House originating all money bills and
voting supplies—turn about, in their capacity of Supreme
Judges, and are allowed to unsettle, if they
please, by their interpretation, whatever the Supreme
Legislative power may choose to enact for
law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But although these three elements can never be
wholly separated—it does not follow that men, who
desire to be well-governed, should not try to separate
them and to keep them separated as far as they can.
Still less, that because they cannot be wholly separated,
they shall therefore be encouraged to run together
and to crystalize into a mischief that may
never be resolved again but by the process of decomposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, I contend that, in effect, <span class='sc'>We</span>, the People
of these United States, are governed by an Oligarchy;
and that, by being allowed to choose our own
masters—provided we choose them, or at least, a
large majority of them, out of a particular class—we
are blinded to the inevitable consequences: till we
mistake words for things, and shadows for substances:
and that our mistake is all the more dangerous
and alarming that we cannot be persuaded to
treat the matter seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I contend, moreover, that, inasmuch as the Lawyers
of our land make all the laws; and as Judges
expound all the laws, and as office-holders carry all
the laws into execution, therefore they constitute of
themselves the Sovereign Power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are the facts questioned? In the Massachusetts
legislature, we have had two hundred and sixty
lawyers out of three hundred and fifty members;
and in congress we had not long ago, the same number,
two hundred and sixty lawyers out of two hundred
and ninety-seven members—the balance being
made up in this way. Manufacturers and farmers,
fifteen: Merchants, one: Unknown, (being mechanics
or preachers, or something of the sort,)
twenty-one. Perhaps there may be some error
here, as I find the only note I have upon the subject
so blurred, that I am not sure of the figures; but the
fact on which I rely is too notorious to be questioned.
Every body knows that lawyers constitute
a large majority in all our legislative bodies, and
have done so for the last fifty years; and that they
make about all the speeches that are made there, or
supposed to be made there, and afterward reported
by themselves for the newspapers. Can it be
doubted therefore, that they as a body do in fact and
in truth constitute our supreme legislative power—thereby
absorbing to themselves just one third part,
and by far the most important part of our whole sovereignty
as a people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As little can it be seriously questioned that, inasmuch
as all our judges, from the highest to the
lowest are lawyers; or ought to be, as they are always
ready enough to acknowledge—they constitute
the supreme judiciary; another third part of our
whole sovereignty as a people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now let us see how the account stands with
the Executive Power. Are not our presidents, and
have they not been from the first—with only three
exceptions out of twelve—lawyers? And our vice
presidents; and all our secretaries of state; and
most of our secretaries of war, and of the navy; and
about all our foreign ministers; our chief clerks,
our post-master generals; our collectors; our land
agents; and even a large proportion of our foreign
consuls—have they not always been, and are they
not always with an ever increasing ratio—Lawyers?
And if so, what becomes of the other third part of
our whole sovereignty as a people—the Executive
Power? It is in the hands of the lawyers; and as
three thirds make a whole—out of the courts of law,
I mean—does it not follow that the whole sovereign
power of this mighty people—of this great commonwealth
of republics—this last refuge of the nations is
in the hands of our lawyers, hardly a fraction of the
whole?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! but we have nothing to fear. Lawyers are
always at loggerheads. They are incapable of
working together, even for mischief. Granted—and
there, let me tell you is our only safety, and our only
hope. But, suppose they should wake up to a
knowledge of their own strength—and of our weakness—who
shall say that they must always be incapable
of conspiring together? And if they did—when
should we begin to perceive our danger?
Would they be likely to tell us before-hand? Or
would they go on, year after year, quietly absorbing
office, power, and prerogative, as all such bodies do;
until they had become too strong for the great unreasoning
multitude. With public opinion—with
long established usage in their favor—with a sort of
hallucination, hard to be accounted for in a jealous
people; acquainted with history, what have they to
fear? Neither overthrow nor disaster—till the
people come to their senses and wake up, and harness
themselves; and then, they are put upon trial, as
with the voice of many thunders; and instantly and
forever dethroned, as by an earthquake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But you do not see the danger. Granted. And
this very thing is what I complain of. Did you see
the danger there would be some hope of you; and it
would soon pass away forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But suppose we take another case for illustration.
Suppose that three-fifths of all our law-makers were
soldiers instead of lawyers. Suppose that all our
judges from the highest to the lowest were soldiers;
and that all our presidents, and secretaries, and
foreign ministers, and collectors, and consuls—with
here and there an exception—were all soldiers;
most of them experienced soldiers—veterans; and
the others, conscripts or new levies—what would be
the consequences, think you? How long should we
be at peace with the rest of the world? How long
would Cuba, Mexico, or the rest of North and South
America be unattempted? Would not our whole
sea-coast, and all our lakes and rivers, and all our
frontiers be fortified and garrisoned? Would there
not be great armies constantly marching and counter-marching
through our midst? Would not our
very dwelling-houses and churches be wanted for
barracks—and if wanted, would they not be taken
by little and little?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would not all our young men be mustering for the
battle-field? Would not foolish mothers, and sisters,
and sweet-hearts, be urging them to try for a
shoulder-knot or a feather, as the only thing on
earth to be cared for by a young man of spirit and
enterprise?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look at Russia. The military have dominion
there—and all the rest of the world are slaves. The
greatest men we have, not bearing a military title,
would be overlooked by the emperor, while any
thing in the shape of a general, though he never
“set a squadron in the field,” and was never heard
of beyond the neighborhood of a militia muster, would
be fastened on horseback, and have thousands and
tens of thousands, from the harnessed legions of the
north, passed in review before him. What wonder
that in such a country, the very nurses of the bed-chamber;
yea, the very bishops of the land have
military titles, and are regularly passed up through
successive grades, from that of a platoon officer to
that of a colonel, and perhaps to that of a field-marshall,
by the emperor himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet soldiers are at least as trustworthy, are they
not—as lawyers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Take another case. It will not be denied, that
physicians on the whole, are about as intelligent and
trustworthy as lawyers. Now, let us suppose that,
instead of being as in the Massachusetts legislature,
eighteen to two hundred and sixty—in a body of two
hundred and ninety-seven; they should happen to
be two hundred and sixty physicians, to eighteen
lawyers, and that in our other legislative bodies they
should constitute a majority of the members: that
all our presidents, and secretaries, and foreign ministers,
and chief clerks, and post-masters, and collectors,
and consuls, were physicians; or as many
as are now lawyers: and that all the laws were
made subject to the decision of a bench of doctors,
eminent for the knowledge of medicine, and for nothing
else—what, think you, would be the situation
of our people under such an administration? Would
any mortal man dare to refuse any pill the president
might offer? Would not our dwellings and churches
be converted—not into barracks, but hospitals?
Would not millions be lavished upon theories,
and experiments, and preparations for pestilence?
Would not the whole country be divided into contagionists,
and non-contagionists—parties for, and parties
against the yellow fever and the cholera?
Would not platforms be established, and pledges required,
and offices filled—here by the believers in
allopathy, and there by the disciples of homeopathy?
To-day, by the rain-water, screw-auger, and vegetable
doctors; and to-morrow, by the unbelievers in
lobelia, bella-donna, and pulverized charcoal, or infinitesimal
silex? In a word, if the government
were allowed to have its own way—and after they
were established as the lawyers are now, how
could you help it?—would not the president, and all
his secretaries be obliged to prescribe for the sovereign
people—or suffering people—gratuitously; and
would not the whole country be drugged, and physicked,
and bled and blistered—samewhat as they
are now—and would not all our finest young men be
rushing into the apothecary shops, and lying-in hospitals,
and clinical establishments for diplomas—to
qualify them for the business of legislation, and for
holding office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again. Suppose we had as many preachers
of the Gospel for lawgivers—for presidents, secretaries,
ministers, etc., and for judges—what
would be our situation? However they might differ
among themselves upon the minor points of their
faith and practice, would they not combine together?
And would it not be their duty to combine, for the
establishment of whatever opinion they might all, or
a great majority of them, have agreed to uphold, as
vital to Christianity? And how could we help ourselves?
And what would become of our ambitious
young men, or still more ambitious daughters?
And what—I beseech you to think of this—what
would become of the right we now claim of judging
for ourselves upon all subjects, that in any way belong
to our everlasting welfare? Yet these men are
honest, and taken together, are they not as trustworthy
and conscientious under all circumstances, think
you, as our present masters, the lawyers? And if
so, would they—or would the physicians, or the soldiers
be a whit more dangerous? Answer these
questions for yourselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I have not finished. I hold that the professional
training of a lawyer disqualifies him for the
very business, which might be entrusted with comparative
safety to the soldier, the physician, or the
preacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And wherefore? Because it substitutes a new
law for the law of God. He that by his professional
adroitness can secure the escape of the
bloodiest and most atrocious criminal from justice,
in spite of the clearest proof, obtains a reputation,
and with it correspondent advantages in wealth, influence,
and power, which under no other circumstances
could he obtain. It is the worst cases,
whether criminal or civil—cases which he gains in
defiance of law, and against evidence—which give a
lawyer reputation. To win a cause which every
body says he ought to win, <span class='it'>that</span> never gives a man
reputation, and is therefore committed to the nobodies
below him. But, if there be a case beyond the
reach of hope or palliation; clear and conclusive
against the party, so that our very blood thrills when
he is mentioned, and no human being supposes he
can get clear; still if he does get clear—no matter
how—by browbeating or bothering witnesses; by
bamboozling the jury, and misrepresenting the evidence
under the direction of the court; or by down-right
bullying; the advocate is complimented by his
brethren of the bar, and even by the bench; for his
learned, ingenious, and eloquent, and faithful vindication
of his client; and he goes forth, carrying with
him these trophies,—and others, it may be—dabbled
and stained with blood, like the murderer’s knife,
with “the gray hair stickin’ to the haft,” only to be
retained in advance by every desperate ruffian, and
every abandoned wretch, who may happen to hear
of the result, and to have the where-withal to secure
his timely co-operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just observe how this affair is managed. If a father
should give aid and comfort to a child, after she
had been guilty of murder; if a husband should open
his doors to a wife, or a daughter to her father, at
dead of night; or furnish a horse, or money, or a
mouthful of bread, or a cup of cold water, or the
means of escape to a beloved brother, hunted for his
life, with the avenger of blood at his heels, time
was, when they were all accessories after the fact,
and were treated as murderers or principals, whatever
might be the offense, and put to death accordingly;
and even yet, although that most barbarous
law has undergone a few changes, so that in some
portions of our country, they who stand in the relation
of husband and wife, or parent and child, may
help one another when fleeing for their lives; yet no
other man, woman, or child can do it, in the whole
community, but at the risk of death or imprisonment
for life—<span class='it'>except he be a lawyer</span>, and the prisoner’s
counsel. And then he may, and he not only may,
but he is expected and required to do so: in other
words, to aid and comfort, counsel and help the prisoner,
heedless of all consequences, here and hereafter.
And for this, he may receive the very gold
which has been wrenched from the grasp of the
murdered man; or the bank bills that are glued together
by his heart’s blood; and nobody shall dare
to question his integrity, or to have any secret misgivings
about his honesty or conscientiousness—if it
can be helped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me not be misunderstood. I do not deny that
the worst of criminals are to be tried fairly. I acknowledge,
moreover, that they cannot be tried
fairly with men of the law against them, unless they
have lawyers to help them: and that it is as much a
part of the law that they shall be tried in a certain
way, and proved guilty in a certain way, for the satisfaction
of the world, as that they shall be punished
at all; and that, if it were enough to be satisfied of
another’s guilt as a murderer, to justify us in putting
him to death, without going through the regular
forms of law, then might we run him up at the next
yard-arm, or tree branch, or lamp-post; on happening
to see the bloody act perpetrated with our own
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how should we know even in such a case,
that “the man was not beside himself;” or that
the homicide was not justifiable, or at least excusable?
He may have acknowledged his guilt. And
what if he has? He may have been mistaken; for
such things have happened, and murders which
never took place—though intended—have been acknowledged,
and the missing parties have re-appeared
after a long while, and explained the mystery.
Or he may have been deranged; or being accused,
and as it were enmeshed by a web of circumstances,
he may have been led away like the
son, who charged himself and his aged father, in
Vermont, with the murder of a poor helpless creature,
who was afterward found alive, by the instinct
of self-preservation; hoping to lengthen, if not to
save his life, at least until his innocence might be
made to appear; and believing his father guilty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To prove all these things there must be a trial,
and a public trial; otherwise, whatever may be the
result, he will not be <span class='it'>proved</span> guilty, according to the
law and the evidence; nor could he be justly condemned;
and there would be no safety for others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No matter how clear his guilt may be; nor how
bad his character may be; the greater his guilt in
the judgment of those who decide against him before
trial, and without evidence upon oath, or sifting, or
cross-examination—the more precious to him and to
all, is the privilege of being put to death according to
law. The fewer his rights, the more sacred they are.
The more decided and overwhelming the evidence
against him, the more necessary it is to wall him
round about, as with a sword that turneth every
way, against the influence of public opinion. It was
in this way that the elder Adams reasoned, when he
undertook the defense of the British officer, charged
with the murder of Boston citizens, at the outbreak
of the revolutionary war—and triumphed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And how shall this be done without the help of a
Lawyer? Law, living a science, complicated, and
full of mystery and fear, how is the poor criminal to
prepare himself? How is he to defend his few remaining
rights? And how is he to bear up against
the ponderous and crushing weight of public opinion?
He cannot. The thing is impossible. He must
have help; and that help must be a lawyer; and that
lawyer must be not only faithful to him, but unable
to take advantage of, or to betray him, if he would;
otherwise the culprit will never trust him, and his
life will be at the mercy of the prosecutor, generally
chosen for his knowledge of the law, and for his
adroitness in making “the worse appear the better
reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, then, a lawyer must be allowed to the
greatest criminal—and the greater criminal he is, the
more lawyers he ought to be allowed—if able to pay
for them! or if the court, in consideration of his deplorable
and hopeless guilt, or the atrocious character
of the charge against him, be willing to assign
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now—being assigned, or otherwise engaged,
what shall the <span class='it'>honest</span> lawyer do? He must be faithful
to his client, happen what may—but is he required
to lie for him? to foreswear himself? As
“the indiscriminate defender of right and wrong,”
to borrow the words of Jeremy Bentham, “seeking
truth in the competition of opposite analogies,” according
to Blackstone, shall he undertake to get the
fellow clear—to bring him off—against law, and
against evidence? If such be the meaning of that
faithfulness to his client, what becomes of his faithfulness
to God?—to his fellow man—to himself?
And yet, where is the great Advocate who does not
glory in doing just this? and who has not gained his
whole reputation by just such cases, and no others?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There stands the murderer, with garments rolled
in blood. There stands his counsel, giving him aid
and comfort, under the sanction of law, with his
right hand lifted to Heaven, and swearing to a belief
in the utter groundlessness of the charge, and calling
upon Jehovah himself to witness for him, that he
speaks the truth! Such things have happened, and
are happening every day; and these honest lawyers
are still suffered to go at large, unrebuked and unappalled:
nay, worse—for by these very practices
they get famous and grow rich and secure the patronage—that’s
the very word—the <span class='it'>patronage</span> of all
the inexorable and shameless villains and cut-throats
in the community.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the lawyer may not do these things
<span class='it'>honestly</span>, what may he do for the help of his client?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He may lay his hand reverently upon the statute
book. He may show that the law does not reach
the case charged upon the prisoner at the bar, and
that he must therefore go free—though his right hand
be dripping and his garments be stiffened with blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He may show that the only witness against him is
unworthy of belief, on account of self-contradictions,
or utter worthlessness; or that he has become disqualified,
by the commission of some offense that
incapacitates him for life; and, by producing the
record of his conviction, he may oblige the court to
let the prisoner go free. All this he may do, and
still be an honest man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet more. Having satisfied himself of the innocence
of the accused; or of the probability that the
witnesses are mistaken, or dishonest, or that they
have conspired together to destroy a fellow creature,
doomed to death by public opinion without proof;
he may put forth all his strength, and appear in
“panoply complete,” heedless of all consequences,
to save him—provided only that he sticks to the
truth, and is honest in what he says or does. I care
not how eloquent he may be, nor how able or ingenious—the
more eloquent and able and ingenious
the better, and I shall reverence him all the more as
an Advocate and as a Man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I do insist upon it, that he shall not be allowed
to forget every thing else—and every other
obligation—and every other law, whether divine or
human, for the sake of his client; and that if he does,
he shall be held answerable for the consequences,
and be punished, as he deserves, with a burst of indignation—a
general outcry of shame on thee for a
traitor!—a traitor to thyself, to thy Maker, and to
thy brethren at large, under pretence of being faithful
to a murderer whom it would be death, perhaps,
for his own mother to help or comfort in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would even allow him to urge upon the jury,
not only in such a case, but in every case where the
punishment might be death, to bear in mind, that no
matter how perfectly satisfied they may be of the
prisoner’s guilt; still, if he has not been <span class='it'>proved</span>
<span class='it'>guilty</span>, by unquestionable evidence, or by unimpeachable
witnesses, according to law, they are
bound by their oaths to return a verdict of <span class='it'>not
guilty</span>; and if they do not, they themselves are guilty
of murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Otherwise they would sanction the most dangerous
of Lynch-laws; those which are executed under
the forms of justice, and in mockery of all human
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If <span class='it'>satisfied</span> of the prisoner’s guilt, they must have
seen the murder perpetrated with their own eyes;
and they must have known that there was no excuse
for it, and no palliation: and in that case, instead
of relying upon questionable testimony from
others, it would be their duty to leave the jury-box
and go into the witness-box, and allow others to
judge of the truth of their story, and of the soundness
of their conclusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I would allow the accused the benefit of
every flaw on the statute, of every error in the forms
of procedure, and of every <span class='it'>reasonable</span> doubt. I
would even suffer him to array as many young
and pretty women as he could entrap into the witness-box
fronting the jury—although, perhaps, I
might object to their appearing in tears or in mourning,
like the Ionians and Greeks and Irish, lest,
peradventure, the tables should be turned, as where
an Irish barrister, pleading the cause of a little orphan,
with the mother and all the rest of the family
standing about with handkerchiefs to their eyes, held
up the boy in tears. The jury, overcome with sympathy
and compassion, were about rendering a verdict
at once, and were only delayed by a question
from the opposite counsel—“My little fellow,” said
he, “what makes you cry?”—“<span class='it'>He pinched me!</span>”
was the answer, and a verdict was rendered accordingly—as
the Irish only are allowed to do it—by
<span class='it'>acclamation</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I should not stop here. I would go further.
For the purpose of fixing forever and ever the responsibility
of a decision upon each of the twelve
jurymen—I would have them polled, and questioned
separately, and man by man (if permitted by the
law,) and not lump their verdict, as they generally
do, hit or miss: and I would call upon each to remember
that if he erred in pronouncing the judgment
of death—of death here, and it might be of death hereafter,
he alone would be accountable—for he, alone,
might interpose if he would, and arrest that judgment
of death, and send the prisoner back to his
family—a living man: and I would so picture his
own death-bed to every man of that jury, if I had the
power, that he should hear himself shrieking for
mercy, and see and feel and acknowledge by his
looks, that if he betrayed the awful trust, or trifled
with it, by deference to others, he himself would be
a man-slayer, and utterly without excuse here and
hereafter, in this world or the next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this I would do, or try to do: for all this might
be done by the <span class='it'>honest</span> lawyer without a violation of
God’s law. But, as I have said before, I would not
have him “play falsely,” nor yet “foully win.” I
would not have him brow-beat nor entrap honest
witnesses. I would not have him guilty of misrepresenting
the evidence nor the law “with submission
to the court.” I would not have the opposite
counsel insulted, nor the bench quarreled with—if it
could be helped—</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Nor everlasting speeches made, with continual asseverations
and solemn appeals to the by-standers and
the public; as if the question of life and death were a
game of chess for the amusement not only of those
who are engaged in it, but for all who may happen to
be near and looking on at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I would have the dignity of the profession
upheld by courtesy and gravity and self-possession—by
varied learning—by the utmost forbearance—by
very short speeches—by the greatest regard for
truth, and by unquestionable conscientiousness under
all circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were this done, the Bar would be sifted and
purged and purified to some purpose. Nineteen
twentieths of the rabble rout who mistake themselves,
and are mistaken by others for lawyers,
would vanish from the face of the earth—and the
profession would then be not only respectable, but
worth following; though, in my judgment, lawyers
would still be the last among us to be intrusted with
a disproportionate share of Legislative or Executive
power; though, from the nature of things they
would be likely to monopolize the whole Judiciary
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That our leading Advocates will not relish this
doctrine, I know. In theory, they may approve—but
in practice, when they and their interest, and
their professional pride are once engaged, they will
never yield. Always taking it for granted that their
client tells the truth—in proportion to the fee; and
always determined to prevail, if they can, right or
wrong, their reformation will depend, not upon
themselves, but upon others—upon the People at
large; for whenever the People say that a professional
acquaintance with law shall be a disqualification
for the business of law-making, and no great recommendation
for office, then will the lawyers of
our country begin to mind their own business, and
cease to be mere politicians, clamoring, open-mouthed,
for office all their lives long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here, lest I may forget them in the proper
place, allow me to illustrate the disposition of the
People to see fair play, by two or three—Joe Millers,
which I never lose an opportunity of telling
under this head. They show that my brethren of
the bar sometimes get their “come ups” where
they least expect it—and very much to the satisfaction
of the multitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is told of Jere. Mason, and of some forty others at
home and abroad, that on being assigned for counsel
to a sad wretch whose case he found to be hopeless,
he went to his cell, and after hearing his story, became
satisfied that the poor fellow would swing for
it, if tried; and so, seeing a sort of window open,
high up and far above the prisoner’s reach if unhelped,
he suggested to him that there was a beautiful
prospect to be seen from that window—perhaps
“the high-road to England,” which the amiable
Dr. Johnson said was the finest prospect a
Scotchman ever sees—and then, seeing the prisoner’s
eyes begin to sparkle, he offered himself as a sort
of ladder or look out, and standing with his back to
the wall, and letting the man climb over him, he
never looked up till it was too late, and the man had
disappeared—whereupon he returned to the court-room,
and on being questioned, acknowledged that
he had given the fellow the best advice he could—which
advice must be a secret from everybody,
since it was the privilege, not of the counsel, but of
the client.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this, you see, was according to law, if not in
fact, at least in principle. A Lawyer might do this—and
escape scot-free, as if it were only a good
joke: while a brother of the prisoner, or a father,
might have been sent to the scaffold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another, for the truth of which I <span class='it'>believe</span> I may
vouch, because I had it, I think, from the lawyer
himself, may serve to show that such faithfulness to
clients may sometimes meet with an appropriate reward.
A member of the Down East bar was called
upon to save a man charged with passing a large
amount of counterfeit money. After a long and
severely contested trial, our “learned, eloquent,
and ingenious” brother got him clear—chiefly by
dint of protestation, coupled with a personal knowledge
of the jury. On being discharged, the accused
tipped him a wink in passing out, and our
learned brother followed him to the lobby. There
they stopped—the liberated man overwhelmed with
thankfulness, and speechless with emotion; being
a father, perhaps, with a large family, or a man of
hitherto irreproachable character, who never knew
how much he was to be pitied till he heard the
speech of his lawyer. Unable to speak—he seized
his hand—slipped something into it—and turned
away, with a word or two, almost inaudible, about
the inadequacy of the acknowledgment, and disappeared
forever. Whereupon, our eloquent, able, and
most ingenious friend, who was a little shy of opening
the parcel in the presence of a bystander, withdrew
to another part of the house, and ascertained—perfectly
to his own satisfaction, he would have you
believe—that he had been paid in the same sort of
money which he had been laboring all day to show
that the accused never had any thing to do with.
And now, on the whole—was not this a capital
joke?—a just retribution, and exceedingly well
calculated to make a lawyer insist upon being paid
before-hand, whatever might be the “contingent
fee” afterward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more—for I do not like being misrepresented
in the newspapers upon this particular point—being
sensitive perhaps about Joe Miller; and,
for that reason, always acknowledging my indebtedness
to him and to his fellow-laborers, the newspaper
people, who never tell a story without spoiling
it, or making it look strange: there is a story
told in England, upon which a play has been founded,
to this effect. A lawyer was called to see a man
charged with sheep-stealing. After a brief consultation,
he saw clearly that, upon the evidence before
him, there was no possibility of escape. And then,
too—probably—the wretch was very poor, being
only a sheep-stealer, and not a murderer, nor forger,
nor house-breaker, nor highwayman, and of course,
would have to be satisfied with poor counsel.
Whereupon the learned gentleman thought proper
to ask him if he had ever been deranged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Deranged?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flighty—you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—yes—to be sure: all my family on my
father’s side have been very <span class='it'>flighty</span>—very.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll do, my friend; that’s enough. You are
charged with stealing sheep—you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fellow began to roll his eyes and look savage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you are called upon to plead—you know
what that is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, just plead to the indictment by saying
<span class='it'>baa-aa</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So said—so done. The prisoner was arraigned.
The indictment was read over to him very slowly
as he sat with his head on one side, looking as
sheepish as possible. And when they had got
through, and he was called upon to say <span class='it'>guilty</span> or
<span class='it'>not guilty</span>, he answered, by saying <span class='it'>baa-aa</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The court being rather astonished, interfered, and
told him what he was required to do; but still he
answered nothing but <span class='it'>baa</span>! Read over the indictment
again, said the judge, and read it very slowly.
The clerk obeyed, and when he had got through,
and was again required to say <span class='it'>guilty</span> or <span class='it'>not guilty</span>,
he answered, as before, nothing but <span class='it'>baa-aa-aa</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A jury was then impanneled to see if he stood
mute “by the visitation of God.” After looking at
his tongue—and his eyes—and feeling his pulse, they
returned a verdict in the affirmative. The man was
forthwith discharged; and the lawyer followed him
out, and touching him on the elbow, held out his hand—<span class='it'>baa-aa-aa!—baa-aa-aa!</span>
said the sheep-stealer—and
vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But enough on this point. If I were to write a
book, I should not be able to do more than I have
done already, so far as the legal and professional
doings of my beloved brethren are concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It remains now, that I should say something very
briefly, of the disastrous consequences flowing from
their political power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, it lures all our young men—the
silliest as well as the cleverest—who desire to live
without work, and to be provided for at the public
charge, to betake themselves to the law. It is not
only the high-road—but the only high-road to political
power. No other profession has a chance with
that of the law; and everybody knows it and feels it
when broad awake and thinking, instead of dozing.
Hence the profession is over-crowded, over-burthened—overwhelmed—and
literally dwarfed into
comparative nothingness, apart from political power;
having not a tittle of the social power it would be
fairly entitled to if it were not so adulterated and
diluted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second place, we have that national reproach—the
instability of our legislation—the perpetual
change, that no sober-minded business-man
is ever able to foresee or provide against.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this I aver to be the natural, the inevitable
consequence of having for our legislators, men who
have a direct personal interest in multiplying or
changing our laws, and in making them unintelligible
to others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us take one of our young attorneys, and follow
him up, year by year, and step by step, to the Halls
of Congress, and see how he gets there, and what
he is bound to do—for he can do nothing else—after
he gets there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, it should be borne in mind, that
the lawyers we send to our legislative bodies, are
not often the able, nor even the ablest of their class—I
speak of them as lawyers only, and not as
Orators, or Statesmen, or Scholars. They cannot
afford to serve the people for the day wages that
your stripling, or blockhead of an attorney, who
lives only from hand to mouth, would snap at. He
who can have a hundred dollars for a speech, will
never make speeches at two or three dollars a-day,
in our State Legislatures, nor be satisfied with eight
dollars a-day in Congress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And these youngsters of the bar, these third and
fourth-rate lawyers, who are held to be good enough
for legislators, because they cannot support themselves
by their profession, how are they trained for
that business?</p>

<p class='pindent'>You first hear of them in bar-rooms and bowling-alleys;
then at ward-caucuses; and then at all sorts
of gatherings where they may be allowed to try themselves
and their hearers; and then at conventions
or town-meetings: and then, after being defeated
half a dozen times, perhaps, till it is acknowledged
that if they are not elected, they are ruined forever,
they get pushed, head-foremost, into the State
Legislature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And once there, what shall they do?—how shall
they manage to become notorious—or distinguished?
They must contrive to be talked about in the newspapers;
to be heartily abused by somebody, that
they may heartily be praised by somebody else belonging
to another perish. Their names at least will
be mentioned, and grow more and more familiar
every day to the public ear, until they become a sort
of household words; or it may be a rallying cry, by
the simple force of repetition, like proverbs, or
slang-phrases. “Why do you take every opportunity
of calling yourself an <span class='it'>honest</span> man?” said a neighbor
to another of doubtful reputation. “Why, bless
your simple heart,” was the reply, “don’t you see
that I am laying a foundation for what is called public
opinion; and that after a few years, when my
character is fairly established, the origin of the belief
will be forgotten.” So with your newspaper characters.
Idols of the day—at the end of a few
months, at most, they are dust and ashes; and the
people begin to wonder at themselves that they
should ever have been made such fools of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how shall they manage to be talked about in
the newspapers, and most gloriously abused? There
is only one way. They must make speeches—if
they cannot make speeches, they may as well give
up the ghost, and be gathered to their fathers; for
most assuredly, (whatever may be their worth, or
strength, or talents, in every other way,) if they
cannot make speeches, not a man of them will ever
be remembered—long enough to be forgotten. And
they must make long speeches—the longer the
better; and frequent speeches—the more frequent
the better; and be their own correspondents and report
themselves for the newspapers, with tart replies
and eloquent outbreaks, and happy illustrations,
never uttered, nor dreamt of till the unpremeditated
battle was over, like some that were made by Demosthenes
himself, years after the occasion had passed
by, and there was nobody alive to contradict him; or
like the celebrated oration of Cicero against Cataline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they cannot make speeches about nothing at
all—at least such is my present opinion—it may be
qualified hereafter, and I am well aware that common
experience would appear to be against me,
and that much may be said upon both sides, as well
as upon neither side, in such a question. They
must have something to work with—and to talk
about: something, too, which is likely to make a
noise out of doors; to set people together by the ears;
to astonish them, and to give them a good excuse
for fretting, and scolding, and worrying. In other
words, they must introduce a new law—the more
absurd the better—or attack an old law, the older
the better; and seek to modify it, or to change or
repeal it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what is the result? Just this; that every
Legislative Hall in the land, from the least to the
greatest, from the lowest to the highest, becomes a
debating-school; and the business of the whole
Country is postponed, month after month, and year
after year, to the very last days of the session, and
then hurried through—just a little too late, wherever
the national honor is deeply concerned, as in the
case of French spoliations, and other honest debts
owed by the Government to the People—with a precipitation
so hazardous and shameful, that much of
the little time left in future sessions must be employed
in correcting the blunders of the past: and all
for what?—merely that the Lawyers may be heard
month after month, and have long speeches that
were never delivered, or when delivered, not
heard, reported piecemeal, and paragraph by paragraph,
in perhaps two or three thousand newspapers—that
are forgotten before the next sun goes down,
and literally “perish in the using.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor does the mischief stop here. The whole
business of the country is hung up—and sessions
protracted for months—and millions upon millions
wasted year after year, of the people’s money, upon
what, after all, are nothing more—and there could not
well be any thing less—than electioneering speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then just look at the character of our legislation.
Was there ever any thing to be compared
with it, for instability, for uncertainty, for inadequacy,
for superabundance, and for what my Lord
Coke would call a “tending to infiniteness!” I acknowledge,
with pride, that our Revised Statutes, all
circumstances taken into consideration, are often
quite remarkable for the common sense of their
language, and for clearness—wherever common
sense and clearness were possible under the established
rules of interpretation. But generally speaking,
what is it? “Unstable as water—thou shall
not excel!” is written upon the great body of our
statute law, year after year, and generation after
generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what are the consequences? Nations are
“perplexed by fear of change.” Better stick to a
bad law, than keep changing a good. The clock that
stands still (to borrow a happy illustration) is sure
to be right twice every twenty-four hours; while
that which is always going, may always be wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us apply this. We are now waiting and
hoping for a change of the tariff: and the more general
and confident the expectation of a change among
business-men, whatever that change may be—up or
down—higher or lower—the more certainly will it
put a stop, or greatly embarrass for a time, the whole
business of the country. And why? If it be generally
believed that the tariff is to be lowered, the
dealers everywhere begin to run off their stocks, to
offer longer credits and better terms; and however
unwilling, shrewd cautious men may be about over-purchasing
with such a prospect before them, there
will be found others, commercial gamblers, or trading
adventurers, who always profit by such occasions
to go ahead of their fellows; for what they
gain is their own, and what they lose, is their creditors’.
And universal overtrading is the consequence
here—and stoppages there—till the mischief corrects
itself or dies out. Business no longer flows in its
accustomed channels. It has fallen into the hands
of comparative stock-jobbers and lottery-dealers:
and a general bankruptcy often follows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But suppose the tariff about to be raised—and the
belief to be universal. The ultimate consequences
are the same, so far as the regular business of the
country is concerned. Manufacturers and jobbers
hold back; they refuse to sell on six months—they
shorten the period of credit—and require acceptances
in town—as being, on the whole, better than to demand
higher rates in advance of old customers.
Purchasers may be eager—but what can they do.
They are obliged to wait—and live on from hand to
mouth—till the question has been settled. And so with
every other great leading law, affecting any great
commercial, farming, or manufacturing interest of
the country. The legislation of a land is a type of
itself. How can our other great institutions be safe
and lasting if our legislation be unstable?</p>

<p class='pindent'>That our legislation is unstable and changing and
fluctuating, who will deny? What great system of
national policy have we ever pursued steadily beyond
the terms of two or three of our political chief-magistrates—a
paragraph at most, in the long History
of the World?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And how should it be otherwise? Lawyers with
us are Conveyancers and Notaries and Special-Pleaders:
and Conveyancers and Notaries and Special-Pleaders
over sea are always, and in our country,
almost always paid by the page; and a certain
number of words, you know, constitute a page at
law. Again—so sure is it that a lawyer shall not
only be heard, but paid for his “much speaking,”
that I do believe people are often better satisfied to
lose a case with a long speech, than to gain it by a
short one. This may appear somewhat startling;
but let us see if, on the whole, it be not substantially
true and no paradox.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man goes to consult a lawyer—you see how
careful I am to distinguish between the two—and
states his case. The lawyer hears him patiently
through—having already touched the fee—and tells
him, without opening a book, or lifting his spectacles,
or moving from his chair, that the question lies
in a nut-shell; and that if his view of the law should
be sustained by the court, of which he cannot be
sure, it may be settled easily and at once. Well—the
case in due time goes up. The jury are empanneled;
a great speech is brewing on the opposite
side; you can hear the whiz of preparation in the
very breathing of the Adversary; but up rises our
friend—by the supposition a very clear-headed, able
and honest lawyer—and so states the principle of
law upon which he depends, that the court rules in
his favor, no speeches are made, and the jury are
discharged. And now comes the tug of war. The
client begs a moment of the lawyer’s time, and asks
what’s to pay: “Fifty dollars.” “<span class='it'>Fifty dollars!</span>—why,
sir—pulling out his watch—you were not
more than—” The lawyer bows, and on turning
away with a stately air, as of one who truly respects
himself, and will not suffer the dignity of the profession
to be trifled with nor tarnished, is stopped by—“I
beg your pardon, squire—there’s the money.
Good morning.” And off goes the client, who has
gained the cause, to complain of the lawyer for extravagance
or extortion; saying that “the case was
plain as a pike-staff—any body might have managed
it—could have done it himself and without help—nothing
but a word or two for the court—never
opened his mouth to the jury—and then, whew!
what do you think he had the conscience to charge?
why, <span class='it'>fifty dollars!</span>—would you believe it! Very
well—much good may the fifty dollars do him; it is
the last he’ll ever see of my money, I promise
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now let me suppose that, instead of going to
the last mentioned, <span class='it'>honest</span> lawyer, he had gone to
some other. He is heard, to be sure, but with visible
impatience: he is continually interrupted and
questioned and cross-questioned, by the half hour.
The learned gentleman has a very large snuff-box on
the table before him—two or three very large portfolios,
and at least a wheelbarrow load of papers tied
with red tape. He takes off his spectacles and snuffs,
and wipes them with his glove and snuffs, and replaces
them and snuffs; now he lifts them and looks
under them, and now he lowers them and looks over
them steadfast and solemn, though troubled and perplexed,
with his mouth screwed up, and making
faces at his client all the time: he shakes his head
and jumps up, and takes a pinch, and then shakes his
head and sits down, and takes another pinch: with a
huge pile of authorities before him, and ever so
many lying open, and having secured a retainer, at
last he tells his client to call on the morrow at 11¼
o’clock <span class='it'>precisely</span>. The client, awe-struck at the
vastness of that legal erudition he has been favored
with a few glimpses of, steals away on tip-toe, rubbing
his hands with delight and astonishment, and
talking to himself perhaps all the way down stairs
and into the street. After three or four consultations
the case comes on for trial. The Adversary goes at
the jury head-first, with a speech varying from two
hours to two days. Of course, it will require from
two hours to two days to answer it—and every thing
must be answered, you know, whether it has to do
with the question or not—as in the passage between
Tristram Bulges and John Randolph, about the
buzzard, or bald-eagle, I forget which; for after all,
there is no great difference between them, as I have
heretofore found to my cost; or as in that between
Webster and Hayne about poor Banquo’s ghost, in
the Senate chamber. And now, having insulted the
witnesses, and the court, and the opposite counsel,
and tired the jury by an everlasting speech, when
they were already more than half asleep; or by arguing
questions of law and fact wholly supposititious,
for the benefit of his younger brethren and the by-standers—the
case goes to the jury, under the charge
of the court perhaps, and is lost. But who cares?—not
the client; for when told that he has a hundred dollars
to pay, instead of fifty as before, he calls it dog-cheap,
and insists upon paying more, and why?
Because <span class='it'>that</span> lawyer had made the case his own—and
he goes about saying, “Didn’t he give it to ’em!—bench,
bar and jury!—didn’t he acknowledge
they were all a set of nincompoops!—and didn’t he
lather my adversary and my adversary’s counsel,
and all his witnesses, little and big, and especially
the women and children, beautifully!—handsomely!—and
isn’t he the man, therefore, not only for my
money, but for the money of all my acquaintances
who may ever want a zealous and <span class='it'>faithful</span> lawyer
to manage their business for them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, though sufficiently absurd, I acknowledge,
is nevertheless true: and happens continually at the
bar. I do not say that in terms a client would prefer
a long speech to a verdict; I only say that such is
the fact, although he may not always know it himself,
in many a troublesome case. And so with
litigants generally; having once entered the “sacred
precincts” of a law-temple, and breathed the
fiery atmosphere, and had their names called over in
a crowded court-room, and thereby having become
famous in their own little neighborhoods, and in the
judgment of their friends and witnesses, people of
large experience and authority, how are they ever
afterward to forego the pleasure? If they win the
first throw, of course they can afford to throw again:
if they lose, they must throw again, the blockheads!
to get back what they have lost, when, like other
gamblers, they promise to stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can it be wondered after all this, that words are
multiplied in our laws, from sheer habit, as well as
from a sort of professional pride, until a mere English
reader, however familiar with the spoken language
and with the best writers of the language,
both at home and abroad, such as Bacon and Bolingbroke
and Hooker and Swift, or Edwards, or
Channing, or the writers of the Federalist, or
Franklin, and half a hundred more I might mention,
would be unable to make head or tail of one paragraph
in three; and few men of business would be
willing to hazard any considerable investment upon
his own understanding or interpretation of any passage
in any new law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talk of the dead languages! The deadest of all the
languages I know, or ever heard of, is the language
of the law! Ask our friend, the learned blacksmith,
and I will abide by the answer. Nobody, not trained
to the business of interpretation—as a dragoman—or
lawyer, would ever think of trying to understand a
new law without help. And even with help—it is
a plague and a mystery till the true meaning has
been settled—<span class='it'>settled!</span>—by adjudication: that is, by
others in authority, the priesthood and the patriarchs,
who, under the name of judges, are paid for
all the thinking, as lawyers are paid for all the talking
to no purpose, permitted at law: for, be it known
to all whom it may concern, that is, to all the non-lawyers
of our land, that no private interpretation
<span class='it'>of law</span> is of any authority <span class='it'>at law</span>: nor is the right of
private judgment recognized or allowed or tolerated
or endured in courts of justice! You must believe
at your peril. You must teach as you are taught;
and grow to the opinions or moulds about you as a
cucumber grows to a bottle; for such is the law, and
with most of the profession, all the law, to say nothing
of the Gospel; for that, perhaps, would be out
of place here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, inasmuch as almost every word of importance
in our language has more than one meaning,
it follows, that in proportion as you multiply
words in a law, or in a legal instrument, you multiply
the meanings, and the chances of mistake, and of
course, I may as well say it, of litigation: and the
mere habit of multiplying words as conveyancers
and special-pleaders and speech-makers, being not
only a professional habit, as every body knows, but
characteristic of the profession, it may be, and often
is, continued from habit, long and long after it may
cease to appear advantageous or profitable; as in the
business of legislation, or in dealing with a jury,
where the lawyer is not paid by the page, but by the
day or the trick. And why? Perhaps my friend
Joe may be permitted to answer. A tailor, while
cutting a coat for himself, was seen to slip a fragment
of the cloth into his cabbage-drawer. Amazed
at such a procedure, a new apprentice took the
liberty of asking why he did it. “<span class='it'>To keep my hand
in</span>,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just so is it with the lawyer. He would use
more words than are either necessary or safe,
merely to keep his hand in, if for no other reason.
Just compare a contract entered into between
shipping-merchants for the sale of a cargo, or between
other men of business, railroad contractors,
or stock-dealers, involving the outlay of millions,
perhaps, with a deed of trust drawn by a thoroughbred
conveyancer, or with articles of co-partnership
by any thing alive in the shape of an attorney-at-law,
if you wish to see the difference between the language
of lawyers, and men of business and common sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this, I would not be understood to say that
some lawyers are never needed for putting the language
and meaning of parties into shape; nor that
“I. O. U.” would be a model for a charter-party, or
a church settlement; for I acknowledge that the
chief business of the world cannot be carried on
<span class='it'>safely</span> without lawyers. I only say, that we have
too many of them; and that they are encouraged to
intermeddle more than is good for themselves, or us,
with every sort of business and branch of the <span class='it'>Lex
mercatoria</span>, and the <span class='it'>Lex non scripta</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another reason why the people are not allowed to
have the laws of their own Country in their own
language, but in that of the learned few—like the
Bible for the Roman Catholics—notwithstanding the
ridiculous parade of publishing all the laws in thousands
of our newspapers in a year—a better hoax,
and a better joke by far than the celebrated bequest
of a guinea, toward paying off the national debt of
our mother country—that mother of Nations, so
cleverly represented by Victoria, just now—is, that
we may <span class='it'>not</span> be able to judge for ourselves; and that
no <span class='it'>law</span> shall be of any private interpretation; for if
it did, the people would soon be independent of most
lawyers; and then, what would become of the superannuated,
and the helpless, the fledglings, and the
understrappers? They would have to rely for support
in their old age upon the interpretation of themselves,
and of their own cramped penmanship, instead
of the legislative enactments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, say certain of my brethren, the law, after all,
is a great science, and the profession worthy of profound
respect. It is over-crowded to be sure; and
some, it must be acknowledged, do not succeed at
the bar, and after trying it for a while are obliged to
leave it, or starve. Granted—but what does that
prove? Can those who do not succeed be greater
blockheads, or greater knaves than many others that
do? And may it not be just possible, if they, who
do not succeed in the profession are otherwise distinguished,
that they had too much self-respect, or
conscientiousness, or what may be called <span class='it'>honesty</span>?
Thus much by way of a protestanda—or the “exclusion
of a conclusion,” according to my Lord Coke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, with all seriousness, what more shall be
said? I have shown: 1.—That my brethren of the
bar enjoy a very dangerous and altogether very disproportionate
power as the law-makers, the law interpreters,
and the law enforcers. 2.—That however
honest they may be <span class='it'>by nature</span>; and however
honest in all the other relations of life; and that they
are so, I acknowledge with pleasure; yet, as Lawyers,
they have a code of morals peculiar to themselves,
making it their duty to league with knaves,
and cheats, and murderers, and house-breakers, and
to furnish them with aid and comfort, <span class='it'>for pay</span>; in
other words, for <span class='it'>a share in their profits</span>, and this
<span class='it'>duty</span> is of such a nature as to lead them continually
astray, to blind their reasoning powers, to darken
their consciences, until they are incapable of distinguishing
between truth and falsehood, or right and
wrong in the defense of their clients; and that under
pretense of being <span class='it'>faithful</span> to them, they become
after a while too unfaithful to everybody else, even
to themselves, and to their Maker; and that <span class='it'>therefore</span>
they are not trustworthy as legislators. 3.—That
in consequence of their position as the holders
of political power, too large a portion of our young
men—our intellectual strength and hope, is diverted
into that particular profession, to the injury of every
other, and especially to the business, and laboring, or
productive professions. 4.—That another evil is our
superabundant legislation—the instability of that legislation—the
prodigious cost of so many debating
societies maintained at the public charge, under pretence
of law-making all over the land; whereby the
public business of the whole country is delayed,
month after month, and year after year; and sometimes
never done—or if done at all, is done at last in
such a hurry, and after such a slovenly fashion, that
when the law-makers are called together again, a
large portion of the little time they are enabled to set
apart from electioneering, is spent in patching up
and explaining the laws of a previous session; here,
by taking a piece off the bottom and sewing it on the
top, as the Irishman lengthens his blanket; and
there, by taking out a piece of the same, to patch a
hole with: and that <span class='it'>therefore</span>, notwithstanding a
multitude of glorious exceptions to be found, year
after year, in the senate chambers and representative
chambers of our country, Lawyers are never to <span class='it'>be
trusted in the making of laws</span>; and that, if it were not
for the simple fact that, as judges, they are the only
authorized expounders of the law, they ought not to
be trusted even with the wording of a statute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, what more? We are all ambitious—lawyers
above all the rest of the world in this country.
Not one but labors—if we may believe his mother
and sister, or his betrothed—not one “but labors
with the nightmare meanings of Ambition’s breast”—not
one who does not feel—</p>

and the Widow, of the Wronged and the Suffering—the
champion of the poor and the helpless—the
refuge of the hunted and betrayed upon earth—let

law, and of nothing but the law, in its vast and magnificent
comprehensiveness; let him consecrate himself
with prayer, and praise, and thanksgiving and
sacrifice—let him go up to the temple with humility
and reverence, and godly fear; and let him take possession
“of the purple robe and diadem of gold,”

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I rose along the sides of that steep cone:</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas like an iron trunk of girdle vast;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The moon’s full globe upon all cities shone;</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Tyre</span>, by the waters; glimmering Ascalon;</p>
<p class='line0'>The City of the Magians, girt with fire;</p>
<p class='line0'>And in the East we saw those mountain ranges</p>
<p class='line0'>Which separate the Nile from sacred Ganges.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Alas! all earthly things have been revised</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Even Learning’s careful patron and Protector,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Inquisition, is disorganized.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The world is round, and has a Radius Vector;</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s not a ghost on duty, nor a spectre;</p>
<p class='line0'>Sinbad is dead, and almost any loafer</p>
<p class='line0'>Can go, in steamers, round Cape Horn to Ophir.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Then, on the blackness of the Night’s deep chasm,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The anchored earth lay, floating, like a floor:—</p>
<p class='line0'>Beneath, the shadow and the veiled phantasm</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Their local habitation had of yore;</p>
<p class='line0'>But each veiled shadow, and each dreadful phasm</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Rose with the night, above the western shore—</p>
<p class='line0'>When, through the void, all flame and ruddy gold</p>
<p class='line0'>The Day-god’s cavalcade, descending, rolled.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Without the continent, old Ocean’s torrent</p>

<p class='line0'>Both jovial Tritons, and the Powers abhorrent,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Were seized of provinces upon the surge;</p>
<p class='line0'>And from Arcturus to the Southern gorge</p>
<p class='line0'>Black tempests bearing old Eolus’ warrant</p>
<p class='line0'>Patrolled the seas in search of ships or steamers</p>
<p class='line0'>Breaking the closes of the ocean emirs.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Through the dense night, archangels of strong wing,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;From heaven roving, saw the earth’s vast plane—</p>
<p class='line0'>The kingdoms of the Pole, all glimmering—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The twisted rivers, and the enfolding main—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The shining gulfs which dent the Indian chain,</p>
<p class='line0'>And smiled to see the hollow planets swing</p>
<p class='line0'>Above that dim abyss within whose core</p>
<p class='line0'>Were hooked the world’s deep sunken anchors four.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Large breakers tumbling on the Arabian shoals,</p>

<p class='line0'>The town of Ebony, the land of Gholes,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(Which are omitted in the modern maps)—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;All these I saw; and hills with misty caps,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where dwell the Glactophagi—blameless souls:</p>
<p class='line0'>The wizard spoke—I was with awe oppressed:</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“These mountains I have watched a thousand years;</p>

<p class='line0'>Yea, Mogophur, the Lord of Babylon,</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Of spearmen, chariots, and Tartarian riders,</p>

<p class='line0'>And elephants crept through the pass like spiders,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the whole College of Magicians came,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Who caused sharp earthquakes and much whizzing flame</p>
<p class='line0'>By means of diagrams, and long dividers,</p>
<p class='line0'>And thus exclaimed each iron-harnessed savage,</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I did but ope one solemn book, and say:</p>

<p class='line0'>At once your tunnels, pumps, and flooms let play;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And loose old Himmalah’s rock-bound fountains.’</p>
<p class='line0'>Then rivers of cold foam and spouting spray,</p>
<p class='line0'>And cataracts which broke the cliffs away,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Burst from the mountains’ inner reservoirs.</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas very good to see those watery Druids</p>
<p class='line0'>Destroy that haughty host, with roaring fluids!”</p>

<p class='line0'><span class='it'>But now, those noisy trumpeters, the Hours,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Blew the reveillé through the camps of morn:</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Now storm-girt Taurus raised his icy horn,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Like blazing silver</span>, o’er the mists and showers;</p>
<p class='line0'>And sunlight struck the unclouded mountain towers,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Which ranged the circuit of that snowy wall:</p>
<p class='line0'>We then rode down a chasm from the gates,</p>
<p class='line0'>And entered Elpholen’s enchanted states.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>To a wild amphitheatre we rode,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Begirt with precipices. From an astounding</p>
<p class='line0'>Cavern in the mountain-side, there flowed</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A river deep and broad; but the surrounding</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Dark hollows echoed not a single sounding;</p>
<p class='line0'>For silently it moved—<span class='it'>we only heard</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>At times the plunging of some dull cascade</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Far up the tunnel, like a cannonade.</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Full many other rivers cross those lands,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Some, from the eternal snows come pouring;</p>
<p class='line0'>Some, roll around the chasms, in foaming bends;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Some, through the hills, a ragged highway boring,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Rush to the valleys, with an angry roaring,</p>
<p class='line0'>And hurry onward to the ocean sands;</p>
<p class='line0'>But many a cataract and runlet trickles</p>
<p class='line0'>Down from the glaciers, making huge icicles.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>We moved along by wooded peaks and crags,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Carvéd with images and hieroglyphs,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Ruffling their scales and quills like golden flags,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>And, pawing their odd cubs, the hippogriffs</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Rolled in their nests, upon the shady cliffs;</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>And in the glens, both bears and royal stags,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>With lazy lions, goats, and yawning leopards</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Like cattle lay, and children were their shepherds.</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Along through ancient forests, vast, and slumbrous,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Roes, of the mountain, grazed beside the springs,</p>
<p class='line0'>And often rose some bird of plumage cumbrous</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Unto the branches, folding his wide wings.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;There, too, were tombs of certain wizard-kings—</p>
<p class='line0'>Antediluvians of visage sombrous—</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>And holy men, before their moss-grown crypts,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Studied in awful Syriac manuscripts.</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Beyond, there dwelleth an immortal folk,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;About a stream, which to a lake enlarges:</p>
<p class='line0'>Pine hills curve greenly round, and groves of oak,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Sometimes they rested on the river marges,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Sometimes they plowed the lake in hollow barges,</p>
<p class='line0'>And sometimes, on the altars made <span class='it'>sweet</span> smoke,</p>
<p class='line0'>Some painted pictures in their pleasant tents,</p>
<p class='line0'>And many played on all stringed instruments.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But some rode up unto the gorgeous clouds</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Around the necks of monstrous eagles clinging.</span></p>
<p class='line0'>The people which do there have their abodes</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Welcoméd them with flags, and wild bell-ringing;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With musical cannon from th’ embrasures flinging</p>
<p class='line0'>Puffs of white vapor, bombs, and rattling grape:—</p>
<p class='line0'>The Goblin-populace of Cloud-land we</p>
<p class='line0'>Could well behold:—Ah, they a brisk folk be!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And caravans continually crossed the plains.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Camels and elephants innumerable—</p>
<p class='line0'>With carriages, and pigmy oxen trains,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And scampering knights, in armor of black shell,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Lords, bearded patriarchs, and gay rabble,</p>
<p class='line0'>And baggage-wagons full of chattering dames,</p>
<p class='line0'>And mounted archers, shooting slender arrows,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wound slowly round the curving river narrows.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But some came down the rivers on broad rafts;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>With shells, and bells, and crooked bugles, waking</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Numberless echoes on the rocks</span>. The shafts</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of the forests stood, like champions unquaking,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Though many clamors, the old silence breaking,</p>
<p class='line0'>Startled the musing Hermits. Now arose</p>
<p class='line0'>The stars, and moon, and all the hosts of night:</p>
<p class='line0'>We stood above a plain upon a height.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Three noble rivers, in the moonlight shining,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Sparkled from three defiles in East, and West,</p>
<p class='line0'>And North—in silence to a blue gulf winding,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Which, by the distant mountains, lay at rest;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And there a city with a massive crest</p>
<p class='line0'>Of turrets, overlooked that rock-bound sheet.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The rivers round it, in broad girdles pressed;</p>
<p class='line0'>Bridges there were, and groves, and gardens meet;</p>
<p class='line0'>And in the bay lay moored an idle fleet.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Unto that city did all people flow:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In the deep plain we saw their circular camps,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like islands of an archipelago;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And as we looked, <span class='it'>a belt of fiery lamps</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Was wound around the crowning citadel;</span></p>
<p class='line0'>Whereat each watching pilgrim said: “Full well</p>
<p class='line0'>I know, that now within yon distant dell</p>
<p class='line0'>The Lord of blessed Elpholen doth dwell.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“To him we will present our offering</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of fruits, and herds, and many precious ores,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which rivers from the mountain-summits bring:—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Upon the gulf’s cool strand, and shady shores</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Our ancient games we will perform long hours:</p>
<p class='line0'>Then we will go again to our dear tribes,</p>
<p class='line0'>And to our cattle in the pleasant meadows,</p>
<p class='line0'>And dappled deer browsing in mountain shadows.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>That night we camped upon the sandy margent</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of an unknown sea; and when, behind sharp peaks,</p>
<p class='line0'>The moon retired in her skiff of argent,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Then certain meteors filled the sky with streaks,</p>
<p class='line0'>And diving, from the zenith-ridge divergent,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Through the purple heavens fell in flakes,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which, as they struck the water, lost their light,</p>
<p class='line0'>And grew a portion of its night.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Meanwhile we saw a corps of sentry ghosts,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Standing erect the farthest Eastern shore on,</p>
<p class='line0'>And many thousand stars, above those coasts,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Flashed like the Arabic of a fiery Koran;</span></p>
<p class='line0'>Then those great captains of the heavenly hosts,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Orion, Sirius, and Aldebóran,</p>
<p class='line0'>On the dark field of Heaven took their stations;</p>
<p class='line0'>And calmly wheeled the close-ranked constellations.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>No outposts of the Morn marked the approach</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of the Hœlios’ chariot; no gleams, or tinges</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon the tent of Darkness dared encroach;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But sudden brilliance pierced its dusky fringes;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Wide swung the Morning’s gates upon their hinges;</p>
<p class='line0'>Those burning horses, and that flaming coach</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Sprang out upon the ocean, through the gateway:</p>
<p class='line0'>Night struck her tattered tent, and vanished straightway.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A YOUNG DREAM.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Memory</span> is certainly a very strange gift, or quality
of the mind—or whatever else it may be rightly
termed; for I am no philosopher, and but little acquainted
with the technology of metaphysics. It
seems often a capricious faculty, selecting its own
objects, and amusing itself with them to the rejection
of others. But I am not quite sure that this imputation
upon memory is justified. I must admit that
with myself, as I suppose is the case with others,
when I try to recall the past, the lady often proves
restive with me, and without any apparent cause,
recalls all the particulars of certain scenes, and
omits other passages of life close by them. Nor is
this to be attributed always to the particular interest
of the scenes she recalls; for some of them are quite
unimportant, light, and even ludicrous, while things
affecting one’s whole destiny, if not utterly forgotten,
are brought back but indistinctly. I suspect, however,
that the fact is, memory is like a sentinel who
will not let any one enter the treasury she guards
without the countersign, even though it be the master
of the treasure himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The objects and events that we remember best
are, in fact, those for which we have learned the
countersign by heart, and the moment that any accidental
circumstance furnishes us with the pass-word,
apparently forgotten, the door is thrown open, and
we behold them again, somewhat dusty perhaps, but
plain and distinct. Acts never die. They at least
are immortal; and I do not think they ever die to
memory either. They sleep within, and it only requires
to have the key to waken them. The time
will come when all shall be awakened: when every
door of the heart shall be thrown open, and when
the spirits of man’s deeds and thoughts will stand revealed
to his own eyes at least—perhaps to be his
bright companions in everlasting joy—perhaps his
tormentors in the hell which he has dug for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often, often, as I look back in life, I see a cloud
hanging over a particular spot in the prospect, which
for days, sometimes for years, will hide all beyond.
Then suddenly the lightest trifle—a casual word—a
peculiar odor—the carol of a bird—the notes of some
old melody, will, as with a charm, dispel that cloud—sometimes
dissolving it in rain-drops—sometimes
absorbing it in sunshine—and all that it concealed
will burst upon the sight in horror or in loveliness.
Even while I have been writing these few pages
many things have thus been brought back to remembrance
by the connection of one event with another,
which seemed to have altogether passed away from
memory when first I sat down to write. Now what
is the next thing I remember; for the rest of our
journey, after we left Juliers, has passed away from
me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I find myself on looking back, in a small, neat
house, with a garden, and a little fountain in the garden,
upon a sandy soil, and with a forest of long
needle-leaved fir-trees stretching out to the westward.
To the east there is a city of no very great
extent, but still a capital, with a range of high hills
running in a wavy line behind, and here and there
an old ruined castle upon the lower points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the city lies a wide plain, rich and smiling,
full of corn-fields and vineyards, with here and there
a curious-looking spire or a couple of dome-topped
towers marking the place of a village or small town,
and beyond the plain, glistening in a long, long
wavy line of silver, glides a broad river—the mighty
Rhine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! what sweet sunny lapses come cheering and
softening the rapid course of life’s troubled stream.
There are several of those green spots of memory,
as the poet calls it—these oases in the midst of the
desert, even within my own remembrance. But on
few, if any of them can my heart rest with as much
pleasure as on the months we passed in that little
cottage. There were no events—there was no excitement—for
me and Mariette, at least. I remember
wandering with her about that sunny garden,
playing with her in the cool, airy pleasure-house
which stood in one corner, helping her to gather
flowers to deck her mother’s table, wandering with
her through the forest beneath the green shade, with
the dry, brown filaments of the fir crackling under
our young feet. Here and there we would come to
a place where oaks and beeches mingled with the
pine and a thick growth of underwood narrowed our
path; but as compensation, we were there sure to
find a rich treasure of wild-flowers, more beautiful
in our eyes than all the garden bestowed. Very often,
too, in the clear May evenings we would sit
under the little shabby porch of the house—Mariette
upon my knee, with her arms clasped round my
neck—and as the sky grew gray, and the stars began
to peer and glimmer up above, would listen to
the notes of the nightingale as he prolonged his song
after all the forest choir had fallen into silence; and
when some of those peculiar notes were coming which
we love the best to hear, and Mariette knew that the
delicious cadence was nigh at hand, she would raise
her beautiful liquid eyes to my face, and whisper
“hark” and gaze at me still as if to share my enjoyment,
and to make me share hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! how that child twined herself round my boy’s
heart. Dear, dear, dear Mariette. In all that I have
seen in life, and strange and varied has that life been,
I have never seen any thing that I loved as much as
you. The first freshness of my thoughts—the first—the
tenderest—the purest of my affections, were all
yours!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I took other tasks in hand. Good Father
Bonneville resumed his lessons to me; but they
were not very burdensome, and I began to teach
Mariette. How this came about I must explain.
Madame de Salins, who had borne up so well in
times of danger and active exertion, became languid,
inactive, sorrowful in the time of repose. She was
evidently exceedingly anxious about something—often
in tears—and often returned from the neighboring
city where she went almost every day to seek
for letters, with a look of gloom and disappointment.
She began to teach Mariette something herself, however;
for from various circumstances the dear
child’s instruction had been neglected. It was always
a task to her, however, and her mind seemed
wandering away to other things, till at length good
Father Bonneville suggested that I would teach Mariette,
and Mariette was delighted, and I rejoiced;
and Madame de Salins, too, was very well satisfied
at heart, I believe. Every thing was speedily arranged,
but Mariette and I set to work formally and
in good order. The books, and the slate, and the
pen and ink were produced at a fixed hour, and if it
were fine weather, we sat in the little shabby porch—if
it were raining, in the little room that looked
upon it. Dear, stupid little thing! What a world
of trouble she gave me. She did not half know her
letters when I began to teach her, and was continually
mistaking the P’s and B’s, and Q’s and D’s.
R and S, too, were sad stumbling-blocks, and the
putting letters together into syllables, together with
pricking the page with a pin occupied a long time.
Then she was so volatile too. When I was pouring
forth my young philosophy upon her, and laboring
hard to teach her the sounds produced by different
combinations of letters, she would start up and dart
out into the garden in chase of a butterfly, or tempted
by a flower. Then, when she came back and was
scolded, how she would coax and wheedle her soft
young tutor, and kiss his cheek and pat his hair, and
one way or another contrive to get the words “good
Mariette” written at the end of every lesson to show
her mother. I have got the book still, all full of pin
holes, and strange figures scribbled on it with a pen;
but not one lesson in it has not “good Mariette”
written at the end, though Heaven knows she was
often naughty enough to merit another comment.
But I was a true lover even then, and perhaps loved
the dear child’s faults.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, at the end of that book of little reading
lessons there is a page which I have kissed a thousand
times since. It represents—and not very badly—Mariette
as she appeared then with a little spaniel
dog looking up in her face. Oh! how well I recollect
when it was drawn. I could always handle my
pencil well, though I don’t know when I learnt
to draw; but as we were coming near the end of
the book, I promised Mariette if she would be a very
good girl indeed, and get through the remaining lessons
in a week, that I would draw her picture at the
end with an imaginary dog which she was always to
have at some indefinite period in the future; for she
was exceedingly fond of dogs, and I believe the
highest ambition of her heart at that moment was to
have a spaniel of her own. Before Saturday night
fell, the lessons were all done, and I was immediately
reminded of my promise. We sat in the
porch, with the western sky just growing purple,
and I made her get up and stand at a little distance,
and sketched her lightly with a pen and ink, and then
at her feet, I drew from memory the best dog I could
manufacture, with its ears falling back, and its face
turned up toward her. How delighted she was
when she saw it, and how she clapped her little
hands! It was all charming, but the spaniel above
all, and I doubt not she was convinced that she
should soon have a dog exactly like that. She ran
with it, first to Father Bonneville, who was in the
next room, and then to her mother, who was very
sad that evening; but she kissed her child, and
looked at the drawing, and dropped some tears upon
it—the traces are there still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mariette came back to me, and thanked and
embraced me, and declared that I was the dearest,
best boy that ever lived, and that when she was old
enough, she would draw me at the end of one of my
books, with a great big dog as big as a horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is all very trifling perhaps, and not much
worthy of record, but in those trifling times, and
those trifling things lie the brightest and the sweetest
memories of my life. It was all so pure, so artless,
so innocent. We were there in that little garden, as
in a Paradise, and the atmosphere of all our thoughts
was the air of Eden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such things never last very long. I reached my
thirteenth birth-day there, and it was kept with
kindly cheerfulness by Father Bonneville and Madame
de Salins. Mariette I remember wove me a
wreath of flowers, and put it on my head after dinner;
but that was her last happy day for a long
while. The next day Madame de Salins walked to
the city as usual, and Father Bonneville went with
her. They were long in returning; but when they
did come back there was a sparkling light in the
eyes of Madame de Salins which I little fancied
augured so much wo to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Louis, come,” said Father Bonneville.
“Madame de Salins has heard good news at length.
She must set out this very evening for England.
The carriage and horses will be here in an hour, and
we must all help her to get ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mariette?” I asked, with an indescribable
feeling of alarm. “Does she stay here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my son, no,” replied Father Bonneville, almost
impatiently. “She goes with her mother of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grown people forget the feelings of childhood,
especially old people, and appreciate too little either
the pangs or joys of youth. Blessed is the man
who bestows a happy childhood upon any one.
We cannot shelter mature life from its pangs and
sorrows, but we can insure, if we like, that the
brightest portion of the allotted space—the portion
where the heart is pure, and the thoughts unsullied—shall
be exempt in those we love from the
pangs, and cares, and sorrows which, so insignificant
in our eyes, are full of bitter significance to a
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville did not know how terribly his
intelligence depressed my heart. He rejoiced in
Madame de Salins’ brightening prospects, although
they deprived him of society that cheered and comforted.
I was more selfish; I thought only that I
was again to lose Mariette, and I grieved from my
very heart. I would not disgrace the first manhood
of my teens by bursting into tears, though the inclination
to do so was very strong, and I assisted in the
preparations as much as I could. But oh how I
wished that some accident might happen to the
horses before they reached our door, or that the carriage
might break down—that any thing might happen
which would give me one—but one day more.
It was not to be, however: the ugly brutes, and the
little less ugly driver, appeared not more than half
an hour behind their time, the baggage was put up,
and Madame de Salins proceeded to the door of the
house. She embraced Father Bonneville tenderly,
and then me, and taking a little gold chain which
she had in her hand, and spreading it out with her
fingers, she placed it round my neck, and I saw a
small ring hanging to it, which I found afterward
contained her own hair and Mariette’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep it, Louis, keep it always,” she said. “I
do not know when we shall meet again; but I pray
God to bless you, dear boy, and repay you for all
you have done for me and mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at that moment that the idea of a long
separation seemed to strike Mariette for the first
time. She burst into the most terrible fit of tears I
ever saw, and when I took her in my arms she
clung round my neck so tight that it was hardly possible
to remove her. Madame de Salins wept too,
but went slowly into the carriage, and Father Bonneville
unclasping the dear child’s arms carried her
away to her mother’s knee. I could bear no more,
and running away to my own little room, gave way
to all I felt; only lifting up my head to take one
more look, when I heard the harsh grating of the
carriage-wheels as they rolled away.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A SUMMARY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I have often thought that it must be a curious, and
by no means unimportant, or useless process, which
the Roman Catholic is frequently called upon to go
through, when preparing his mind for confession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The above sentence may startle any one who reads
these pages, and he may exclaim—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Roman Catholic!” Is not the writer—born
in a Roman Catholic country, educated by a Roman
Catholic priest, and with the force of his beautiful
example to support all his precepts—is he not himself
a Roman Catholic, or does he mean to say that
he has never himself been to confession?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never mind. That shall all be explained hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The process I allude to is that of making, as it
were, a summary of all the acts and events, which
have occurred within a certain period of the past,
trying them by the test of reason and of conscience,
and endeavoring to clear away all the mists of passion,
prejudice, and error which crowd round man
and obscure his sight in the moment of exertion or
pursuit. Such is not exactly the task I propose to
myself just now. All I propose to myself is to give
a very brief and sketch-like view of the facts which
occupied the next two or three years of my life. It
will be faint enough. Rather a collection of reminiscences
than of any thing else—often detached
from each other, and never, I fear, very sharply defined.
The truth is, events at that period were so
hurried that they seemed to jostle each other in the
memory, and often when I wish to render my own
thoughts clear upon the particular events of the
period, I am obliged to have recourse to the written
or printed records of the events, where they lie chronicled
in the regular order of occurrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know that after Mariette’s departure, I was very
sad and very melancholy for several weeks. Father
Bonneville with all his kindness and tenderness, and
with much greater consideration for the faults and
weaknesses of others than for his own, did not seem
to comprehend my sensations at all at first, and could
not imagine—till he had turned it in his own mind a
great many times, and painted a picture of it, as it
were in imagination, that the society of a little girl
of six years old could have become so nearly a necessity
to a boy of thirteen. He became convinced,
however, in the end that I was, what he called
“pining after Mariette.” He strove then to amuse
me in various ways—occupied my mind with fresh
studies—procured for me many English books, and
directed my attention to the study of German, which
he himself spoke well, and which I mastered with
the ready facility of youth. We all know how children
imbibe a language, rather than learn it, and I
had not at that time lost the blessed faculty of acquisition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this had its effect, while I was busying my
mind with other things—for I pursued every object
with earnestness, nay with eagerness—I thought
little of my loneliness, but often when my lessons
were done, and I was tired of reading, and indisposed
to walk, I would sit in our little garden, and
looking round upon the various objects about me,
would recall the pretty figure of my dear little lost
Mariette dancing in and out amongst the trees and
shrubs, and almost fancy I heard her sweet voice,
and the prattle which used so to delight me,
strangely mingled as it was, of the innocent frankness
of her nature, and a certain portion of shy reserve,
which had been forced into her mind by the
various painful scenes she had gone through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening as I was thus seated and looking out
upon the road, which ran between our small house
and the forest, I saw an old woman coming down
from the high road which led to the town with a slow
and weary pace. I should not have taken much notice
of her, perhaps, had not her dress been very different
from that of the peasantry in the neighborhood.
It was a dress which awakened old recollections—that
of the Canton in which I had been brought up,
if not born. There was the white cap, with the long
ears flapping down almost to the shoulders, and the
top running up and curling over into a sort of helmet
shape—Heaven only knows how it was constructed;
but it was a very complicated piece of architecture.
Then again there was the neat little jacket of dull
colored gingham, and beneath it the short petticoat
of bright red cloth, with the blue stockings, and the
red embroidered clocks, and the high-heeled shoes
with the silver buckles in them. She carried a good
sized bundle in her hand, and held her head upright,
though she was evidently tired. But as she came
nearer, I saw a round, dry, apple-like face, with two
sparkling black eyes and a nose of extensive proportions.
I was upon my feet in one moment, and the
next, good old Jeanette was in my arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I need not say how rejoiced I was to see her, or
how rejoiced was also Father Bonneville, nor need
I tell all her simple history since we had left her in
France; nor how we wondered at her achieving so
long a journey in perfect safety. Her account, however,
showed how simple the whole process had
been, though I do not mean to say that Jeanette put
her statement altogether in the most simple terms.
She was not without her own little share of vanity,
innocent and primeval as it was. She did not, indeed,
strive to enhance the value of her services and
affection toward us, but she seemed to consider that
she was magnified in abstract importance by dangers
undergone and privations suffered. She told us how
far she had walked on foot, where she had got a Diligence,
where somebody had given her a ride in a
cart, where she had got no supper, where she had
got a good one, where she had been cheated of fifteen
sous at least, and where the landlord and landlady
were good honest people, and had treated her
well for a reasonable remuneration. Her great difficulties
had begun in Germany; the language of
which land she understood not at all, but by dint of
patient perseverance, and asking questions in French
of every person she met—whether they understood
that language or not—she had made her way at
length to the spot which good Father Bonneville’s
last letter had indicated as his place of residence, not
having gone, by the nicest calculation, more than
eight hundred and seventy-four miles out of her
way. She looked upon it as a feat of great importance,
and was reasonably proud of it; but she
thought fit to assign her motives for coming at all—although
those motives were not altogether very
coherent, nor did the premises invariably agree with
the deductions. Indeed, Father Bonneville was a
little shocked at some of the proceedings of his good
housekeeper; for he had a great objection to using
dirty arms against those who even used dirty arms
against him. It seemed that after Jeanette had notified
his absence to the municipality, his books,
papers, and furniture had been seized for the rapacious
maw of the public good. An auction had been
held on the premises, and every thing had been sold;
but Jeanette boldly produced a claim upon the effects
of the absconding priest for a great arrear of wages,
which she roundly asserted had never been paid.
She brought forward the agreement between Father
Bonneville and herself, in which the amount to be
paid monthly was clearly stated, and as the commune
could show no receipts it was obliged to pass
the good housekeeper’s account, and pay her the
money out of the funds raised by the sale. Some
laughed, indeed, and said that the good woman had
learnt the first grand art of taking care of herself,
while others defended her on the ground that it was
rather laudable than otherwise to pillage an aristocrat.
They cited even the cases of Moses and
Pharaoh, where the plunder of the Egyptians was not
only lauded, but commanded. An old touch of religious
fanaticism reigned in that part of the country,
and men, even the most atheistical in profession and
in action, which is still more, could quote Scripture
for their purpose when it served their purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are told that the devil does the same—and I
think it very likely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sum thus received from Jeanette—swelled by
every item she could think of, was by no means inconsiderable;
but she had not cheated a fraudulent and
oppressive civic government for her own peculiar
benefit. The sum which had been left her by Father
Bonneville, and the wages which had been paid
her, sufficed to maintain her for several months in
Angoumois—in her frugal mode of living—and to
carry her across the whole of France, leaving her
with some dozen or two of livres at the time she
reached us in Germany. The money which she had
obtained from the commune, all carefully deposited
in a canvas bag, she produced and placed in the
hands of Father Bonneville, who, to say sooth, did
not well know what to do in the peculiar circumstances
of the case. Jeanette justified her acts and
deeds toward the commune upon the same principle
on which some members of the commune had justified
her supposed acts toward Father Bonneville.
She did not know much about spoiling the Egyptians
indeed; but her mind was not sufficiently refined
to see the harm of cheating cheats, or spoiling
plunderers of part of their plunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe the good Father talked to her seriously
on the subject when I was not present; but what
became of the money I do not know. All I can tell,
is, that the good Father never seemed to be actually
in want of money, and that all those romantic distresses
which hinge upon the absence of a crown-piece,
were spared us even in our exile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed. Jeanette was fully established in
her old post in the household, with the addition of
another German maid-servant. The one whom she
found with us was strongly imbued with despotic
ideas; and was, for good reasons, unwilling to submit
either to the orders of a foreign superior in her peculiar
department, or to the inspection of accounts
and prices which she soon found was to be established.
Another German girl, consequently, was
sought for and found, who being younger in age, unhardened
by experience, and of a diffident nature,
willingly undertook to receive a dollar and a half a
month, and do the harder work of the house under
the orders of Jeanette, of which she did not understand
one word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our peaceful state of existence, however, was not
destined to be of very long duration. The successes
of the allies, then combating the republicans of
France, both on the northern and eastern frontier,
insured us, for some time, tranquillity and safety.
We heard of the defeat of the French army at Neerwinden,
and the fall of Valenciennes and <a id='cond'></a>Condé,
mixed with vague rumors of the defection of <a id='dum1'></a>Dumouriez,
and the flight of some of the most celebrated
generals in the French army. These latter
events gave great joy and satisfaction to Father
Bonneville; for his hopeful mind looked forward to
the re-establishment of law and order in his native
country, and to the utter abasement of the anarchical
party in France before the skill of <a id='dum2'></a>Dumouriez, and
the bayonets of the Austrians joined with those of
all the well disposed and moderate of the land
itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many others shared in the same delusions; but
the manifestoes of the Austrians, soon checked all
enthusiasm, even on the part of the emigrants. No
pretence was made of coming to support the loyal
and orderly in the re-establishment of a monarchy, and
a war of aggression and dismemberment was gladly
commenced against France from the moment that
<a id='dum3'></a>Dumouriez’s more generous—and I must say, more
prudent schemes, were rendered abortive by circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubtless, this first raised some indignation in the
bosom of Father Bonneville, who was of too true and
really loyal a nature to see unmoved, his native land
partitioned by the sword, upon any pretence or coloring
whatever. I do not know why, but these matters
did not appear to me in the same light. I
thought the people of France had committed a great
crime, and deserved to be punished, as if they were
but one simple, individual man. I thought that all
who were genuine loyalists or supporters of an orderly
and constitutional system were guilty of a
crime little less great than that of the anarchists, in
their dastardly holding back when great questions involving
the whole fate of France, hung upon the simple
exertion of a well ordered body of the bourgeoisie;
and I saw not why they should not be punished
for their culpable negligence which was more
disastrous in effect than all the virulence of the terrorists—I
saw not why those who committed tremendous
crimes under the name of justice should
not be brought under the sword of justice, and I
looked forward, I confess, to a period of retribution
with no little joy and satisfaction. It mattered not
to me, in my ignorance of great affairs whether this
was effected by the Austrians, the Prussians, or any
other nation on the face of the earth, but France
deserved punishment, and I hoped she might be
punished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The expectations of retribution were destined to
be long unfulfilled. The manifestoes of the Allies
acted with singular power and significance, producing
combinations not at all expected. The royalists,
the constitutionalists, who still remained in France,
prepared to resist operations, the avowed object of
which was the dismemberment of France itself, and
not the restoration of a purified monarchy. They
were willing to support even their mortal enemies
within the land, in resisting the newly declared enemies
of the whole land, who were advancing along
two frontiers. The republicans were roused to the
most powerful and successful exertions in order to
repel a slow and cautious, but victorious enemy from
their frontiers, and even the émigrés, who were scattered
all along the banks of the Rhine, protested
loudly against a scheme, which not only menaced
the integrity of France as it then existed, but threatened
to deprive the monarchy of some of its fairest
provinces, if the legitimate line of their sovereigns
should ever be restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No contrivance could have been devised so well
calculated to reunite the greatest possible number of
Frenchmen in opposition to a counter-revolution,
and to render all others indifferent to the progress of
the allied arms, as the proclamation of the Prince of
Coburg. Some few, indeed, thought with me, but
mine were doubtless boyish thoughts: for I have
ever remarked that it is experience, and the hard
lessons of the world, which bring moderation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville seldom talked upon these subjects
with me; for he had rightly no great opinion
of my judgment in matters of which I could have
had but a very vague knowledge, and he little knew
how often and how deeply I thought upon such
questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The siege and capture of Mayence, however: the
inactivity of Custine, and the retreat of the whole of
the French armies within the frontier line, seemed
to insure to us perfect security, for a long time to
come, in our calm and pleasant retreat upon the
banks of the Rhine: when suddenly burst forth that
wild and vengeful spirit of reaction which armed all
France, almost as one man, against attacks from
without, and soon retrieved all she had lost under a
weak government and inexperienced commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the end of the year, our situation became
somewhat perilous. After a long period of successes,
the fruits of which were all lost by indecision or
procrastination, the allied armies found themselves
the assailed rather than the assailers, the conquered
rather than the conquerors; and the fierce spirit of the
Frank, the most war-loving, if not the most warlike,
of all the nations of the earth was soon ready to
carry the flaming sword into all the neighboring
lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have given this little sketch merely to connect
the events together, without at all wishing to imply
that I knew or comprehended all the facts at the
time, or recollect them now, except with the aid of
books. My own memories are very slight and
merely personal. I remember lingering on for some
months in that small house by the Rhine. I recollect
the warm, bright summer sinking down into
heavy autumn, and the year withering in the old age
of winter. I recollect numerous reports and rumors,
and gossip’s tales, and—falser than all—newspaper
narratives, and printed dispatches, reaching us in
our solitude, some of them exciting my wonder, and
some of them my alarm, and then I recollect various
passages of no great importance in a somewhat
long journey, till I find myself in a quaint old town
upon the border of Switzerland, near which the
Rhine breaks over high rocks and forms the cascade
of Schaffhausen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This place is only notable in my memory for the
beauty of the water-fall, which I have since seen
surpassed in grandeur, but not in picturesque effect,
and by one little incident which there brightened
many an hour. One day, when we were there, a
letter was delivered to Father Bonneville, in my
presence, which he found to contain a small note
addressed to me. It was the first letter I had ever
received in my life, although I was now between
fourteen and fifteen years of age, and the sensations
which I experienced when it was placed in my
hands, and I saw my own name on the back, were
very strange. Imagination went whirling here and
there, seeking to divine whence it could come. The
mystery of my own strange, isolated existence—which
was frequently present to my thoughts, was
the first thing that fancy snatched at; but I did not
remain long in uncertainty. The seal was soon
broken, and I found a few lines in a round, childlike
hand, very well written, and very well expressed,
with the name of “Mariette de Salins” at the
bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told me that she wrote to show me, her dear
instructor, how much progress she had made in her
studies; and to tell me that although she had now a
great number of companions, she loved me as well as
ever, and better than them all. She bade me not
forget her though she did not doubt that I had
grown a great, tall man, and she was still but a little
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot express how much pleasure this gave me;
for I had been oppressed by the thought that in new
scenes and new circumstances, all memory of her
young companion would soon be obliterated in the
mind of my little Mariette. That such had not yet
been the case was in itself a pleasure; but I calculated
sagaciously that the very fact of having to
write to me, and to recall our youthful intercourse
would renew all her recollections of the time we
had passed together, and give memory, as it were, a
new point to start from.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our stay in Schaffhausen only continued a few
months; for the progress of events in France, and
the revolutionary spirit which began to effect other
countries, left it hardly possible for emigrants to find
any secure spot in Europe, except indeed in England,
and thither Father Bonneville did not seem
inclined to go. At Schaffhausen, however, I pursued
my studies very eagerly, and had the opportunity
of acquiring some knowledge of those manly
exercises which I had never yet had any opportunity
of practicing. There was a very good riding-school in
the town, to which Father Bonneville sent me every
day; and a French exile, celebrated for his knowledge
of the sword exercise, had set up a fencing
school, in which I soon became a favorite pupil. I
was now a tall, powerful lad, and what between the
continual exercise of the riding-school, and the Salle
d’Armes, all the powers of a frame, naturally robust,
were speedily developed. Previous to this time, I
had stooped a little from the habit of bending over
books and drawings; but my chest now became expanded,
my step firm, and I acquired a sort of military
air, of which, I need hardly say, I was very
proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus passed four months and a few days; but
rumors of the intention of the French to march an
army up the Rhine, induced Father Bonneville to
move our quarters, and about a fortnight before my
fifteenth birth-day, we traveled up to Constance, and
then across what they call the <span class='it'>Boden See</span>—or lake
of Constance, to the Vorarlberg.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHANGING SCENES AND THOUGHTS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>We passed some time in Switzerland, wandering
from place to place, and never remaining for above
a few months in any. Though not very rich, we
were never in want of money; but it seemed to me
that Father Bonneville protracted his stay occasionally
in different towns, waiting the arrival of letters,
and I concluded—having now acquired some
knowledge of the general affairs of life—that these
letters contained remittances. Whence they came,
or by whom they were sent, I did not know;
for Father Bonneville transacted all his money
affairs himself, but at the age of sixteen he began to
make me a regular allowance, too much for what is
usually called pocket-money, and enough to have
maintained me in a humble mode of life, even if he
had not paid the whole expenses of housekeeping.
With this money, at first, I committed, as I suppose
all boys do, a great number of follies and extravagancies.
I bought myself a Swiss rifle, and became
a practiced shot, not only in the target-grounds, but
upon the mountains, and Father Bonneville, seeming
now to judge that the education of my mind was
nearly completed, encouraged me to pursue that
education of the body in which the good old man
was unable himself to be my instructor. The Swiss
hunters, however, were good enough teachers, and
I acquired powers of endurance very serviceable to
me in after life. About this period, however, although
I was full of active energy, and fond of every
robust exercise, a new and softening spirit seemed
to come into my heart. Vague dreams of love took
possession of me, and pretty faces and bright eyes
produced strange sensations in my young bosom. I
became somewhat sentimental, bought Rosseau’s
<span class='it'>nouvelle Heloise</span>, and poured over its burning, enthusiastic
pages with infinite delight. The beautiful
scenery, which before had only attracted my attention
by the effect of the forms and coloring upon the
eye of one naturally fond of the arts, now seemed
invested with new splendor, and the very air of the
mountains fell with a sort of dreamy light, streaming
from my own imaginations. I peopled the glens and
dells with fair forms. I walked over the mountain-tops
with beautiful creations of fancy. My daily
thoughts became a sort of romance, and many a
strange scene was enacted before the eyes of imagination
in which I myself always took some part, as
the lover, the deliverer, or the hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was my little Mariette forgotten all this time?
Oh no! Although I could not give her features or
her look to the pretty girls of the Canton with whom
from time to time I dallied, yet I pleased myself by
fancying that there was some trait of Mariette in
each of them, and I do not recollect fancy ever having
presented me with a heroine for my dreams in
whose fair face the beautiful, liquid eyes of Mariette
did not shine out upon me with looks of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not believe that amongst all the many books
which have been written to corrupt the heart of
man—and they are ten times in number, I fear, those
which have been written to improve it—there is one
to be found so dangerous to youth as the works of
Rousseau. The vivid richness of his imagination,
the strong enthusiasms of the man, and the indefinite
insinuation of pernicious doctrines can be only safely
encountered by reason in its full vigor, aided by experience.
I happily escaped the contamination, but
it was by no powers of my own. Father Bonneville
found Rousseau lying on my table, and when I
returned from one of my long rambles he sat down
to discuss with me both the character of the man,
and the tendency of his writings. He showed no
heat, no vehement disapprobation of the subject of
my study; but he calmly and quietly, and with a
clearness and force of mind I have seldom seen
equaled, examined the doctrines, dissected the arguments,
tore away the glittering veils with which
vice, and selfishness, and vanity are concealed, and
left with too strong a feeling of disgust for the unprincipled
author, for my admiration of his style and
powers of imagination ever to seduce me again. I
felt ashamed of what I had done, and when the good
Father closed the book which he had been commenting
upon, I rose, exclaiming, “I will never read
any more of his works again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so, Louis,” replied the good Father. “Do
not read his works at present. Pause till you are
thirty. Your reason may be active, and I believe it
is; but the mind, like the body, only acquires its
full vigor after a long period of regular exercise and
training. You will soon have to mingle largely
with the world, to share in its struggles, to taste its
sorrows, and to encounter its disappointments. You
will see much of man and his actions. Mark them
well. Trace them back to their causes. Follow
them out to their consequences. It is a study never
begun too soon, and about five or six-and-twenty, men
who wish to found virtue upon reason, apply the
lessons they have thus learned to their own hearts.
If you do this, wisely and systematically, neither the
works of Rousseau, nor of any other man will do
you any harm. But here is another thing I wish to
say to you, Louis. The income that is allowed you
is intended to give you some means of practically
learning to regulate your expenditure—to teach you,
in fact, the value of money. This is a branch of
study as well as every thing else, and each young
man has to master it. At first, when he possesses
money, his natural desire is to spend it upon something
that he fancies will give him pleasure; it matters
not what; and when he has wasted numerous
small sums upon trifles which afford him no real
satisfaction, he finds that there is some object far more
desirable, which he has not left himself the means
of obtaining. Then comes regret, and it is very
salutary; for when the experiment has been frequently
repeated, reason arrives at a conclusion, applicable,
not only to the mere expenditure of money,
but to the use of all man’s possessions, including the
faculties both of mind and body. The conclusion I
mean, is, that small enjoyments often kill great
ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening’s conversation I shall never forget.
It afforded me much matter for thought at the time,
and I have recurred to it frequently since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another little picture stands forth about this time,
clear and distinct upon the canvas of memory, and I
strongly suspect that the fact I am about to mention
had a great influence on my after life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were then at Zurich, and I had been out on
one summer evening for a long ramble through the
hills. When I re-entered the town, it was dark,
and going into the house of which we rented a part,
I found a stranger sitting with Father Bonneville.
He was a very remarkable man, and you could not
even look at him for a moment without being struck
by his appearance. His dress was exceedingly
plain, consisting of a large, black, horseman’s coat,
with a small cape to it, and a pair of high riding-boots;
and round his neck he had a white cravat of
very many folds, tied in a large bow in front. He
was tall and well-proportioned, and of the middle
age; but his head was the finest I think I ever beheld,
and his face a perfect model of manly beauty.
I shall never forget his eye—that eye so soon after
to be closed in death. There was a calm intensity
in it—a bright, searching, peculiar lustre which
seemed to shed a light upon whatever it turned to;
and when, as I entered the room, it fixed tranquilly
on me, and seemed to read my face as if it were a
book, the color mounted into my cheek I know not
why. He remained for nearly an hour after my arrival,
conversing with my good old friend and myself
in a strain of sweet but powerful eloquence, such
as I have never heard equaled. During a part of
the time the subject was religion, and his opinions,
though very strong and decided, were expressed
with gentleness and forbearance; for he and Father
Bonneville differed very considerably. The stranger,
indeed, seemed to have the best of the argument,
and I think Father Bonneville felt it too; for he became
as warm as his gentle nature would permit.
In the end, however, the stranger rose, and laid his
hand kindly in that of the good priest. “Read, my
good friend,” he said. “Read. Such a mind as
yours should not shut out one ray of light which
God himself has given to guide us on our way. We
both appeal to the same book as the foundation of
our faith, and no man can study it too much. From
the benefit I myself have received from every word
that it contains, I should feel, even were there not a
thousand other motives for such a conclusion, that
there is something wrong in that system of religion
which can shut the great store-house of light and
truth against the people for whose benefit it was
provided.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment he was gone I exclaimed eagerly,
“Who is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the best and greatest men in the world,”
replied Father Bonneville, “That is Lavater.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would fain have asked more questions, but
good Father Bonneville was evidently not in a mood
for further conversation that night. The visit of
Lavater had pleased him—had interested him; but
things had been said while it lasted which had afforded
him matter for deep thought—nay, I am not
sure but I might say, painful thought. I could tell
quite well by his aspect when there was any vehement
struggle going on in the good man’s mind, and
from all I saw I thought that such was the case now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after, he went to call upon Lavater,
who was living in the same town, but he did not
take me with him. Lavater came again and again
to see him, and they had long conversations together,
at some of which I was present, at others
not; and still there seemed to be a struggle in Father
Bonneville’s mind. He was very grave and
silent, though as kind and as gentle as ever—fell
often into deep reveries, and sometimes did not hear
when I spoke to him. At length, one day, when I
returned somewhat earlier than usual from my afternoon
rambles, I found him bent over a table reading
attentively, and coming in front of him, I perceived
not only that the tears were in his eyes, but that
some of them had dropped upon the page. He did
not at all attempt to conceal his emotion, but wiped
his eyes and spectacles deliberately, and then laying
his hand flat upon the page, he looked into my face,
saying, “Louis, you must read this book; let men
say what they will, it was written for man’s instruction—for
his happiness—for his salvation. It contains
all that is necessary for him; and beyond this,
there is nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked over his shoulder and found that it was
the Bible. “I thought I had read it long ago,”
added Father Bonneville, “but I now find that I have
never read it half enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will read it very willingly, Father,” I replied,
“but Father Mezieres to whom you sent me preparatory
to my first communion, told me, that if not
an actual sin, it was great presumption in a layman
to read any part of it but the New Testament.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind not that, my son,” replied Father Bonneville.
“It is hard to struggle with old prejudices;
to root out from our minds ideas planted in our youth,
which have grown with our growth and strengthened
with our strength. But in this book there is life,
there is light, and God forbid that any man should be
prevented from drinking the waters of life freely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint smile came upon his face as he spoke, and
after a moment’s pause, he continued, saying, “Do
you know, Louis, I am going to become a boy
again, and recommence my studies from a new
point. Some months hence I will talk with you
further, and every day in the mean time I will have
my lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had his lesson, as he said, each day; for he
would sit for hours poring over either the pages of
the Bible or some book of theology; but from that
day I am quite sure that Father Bonneville was, at
heart, a Protestant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is only one other incident worthy of notice
which I remember in connection with the events of
which I have just spoken. That was our separation
from good Jeanette, who had hitherto been the companion
of all our travels. For more than a month
after our arrival in Zurich I remarked that she
looked anxious and uneasy. She said nothing on the
subject of her own feelings, however, to me, but
was less communicative and more thoughtful than
usual, would be in the same room with me for a long
time without speaking one word to him who was I
knew the darling of her heart, and was more than
once spoken to without appearing to hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length one day when I entered Father Bonneville’s
room I found her standing before him; and
heard her say as I came in, “I must go and see my
lady. I am sure she is ill and wants help. I must
go and see her. I have done nothing but dream of
her every night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Jeanette, well,” replied he, “you must
have your way; but you know not what you
undertake. At all events you had better stay till
some favorable opportunity can be found for sending
you in safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jeanette only shook her head, however, repeating
in a low voice, “I must go and see my
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She remained with us two days after this interview,
and I recollect quite well her coming into my
room one night just as I was going to bed, and looking
at me very earnestly, while I, with sportsman-like
care, was cleaning my rifle ere I lay down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Monsieur Louis,” she said in a somewhat
sad tone, “you are growing a man quite fast, and I
dare say, you will soon be a soldier; but do not get
into any of their bad ways here; and never, never
forget your religion. They turn older and wiser
heads than yours or mine; but do not let them turn
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fear, I hope, Jeanette,” I answered; “but
what do you want, my dear old dame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, nothing, but only to see what you are
doing,” she replied. “I see your light burning
often late of nights, and I thought you might be reading
bad books that craze many strong brains. Better
clean a gun by far, Louis—only never forget your
religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I smiled at her anxious care of one no longer a
boy, little thinking that I was so soon to lose one so
closely connected with every memory of my youth,
but when I rose the next morning somewhat later
than usual, Jeanette was gone; and all I could learn
from Father Bonneville was that she had set out
upon a long and difficult journey, the thought of
which gave him much uneasiness.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE PLEASURES OF BATTLE.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.2em;margin-bottom:1.2em;'>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was coming down the hill, and about five miles
distant from the town, but my eyes had been rendered
more keen by my hunter’s sports, and I was
quite sure that it was so. The glittering of arms,
both upon the heights above the city, and in the
valley on the other side of the river, was perfectly
distinct. Yet so still and silent was every thing,
that I could hardly believe two hostile armies were
there in presence of each other. Not a sound broke
the stillness of the mountain air. No trumpet, no
drum was heard at that moment; and my companion,
Karl, would not believe that what I said was true.
Soon after, we dipped into one of those profound
wooded ravines which score the side of the mountains,
and the scene was lost to our sight; but as we
crossed over one of the shoulders of the hill again,
and were forced to rise a little, in order to descend
still farther, the loud boom of a cannon came echoing
through the gorges, like a short and distant clap
of thunder. The moment after, the full roar of a
whole park of artillery was heard, shaking the hills
around; and when we topped the height, we could
see a dense cloud of bluish smoke rolling along to
well-defined lines below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Karl paused abruptly, saying, “We are well here,
Louis. Better stay till it is over. We can help
neither party, and shall only get our heads broke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such reasoning was good enough for him—an
orphan and tieless as he was—a mere child of the
mountain; but I thought of good Father Bonneville,
and told him, at once, that I should go on, and why.
He would then fain have gone with me; but I would
not suffer him; and leaving the chamois with him, I
hurried as rapidly down as I could, taking many a
bold leap, and many a desperate plunge, while the
sound of cannon and musketry kept ringing in my
ears, till I reached a spot where it was absolutely
necessary to pause, and consider what was to be
done next. I had come unexpectedly, not exactly
into the midst of the battle that was going on, but
to a point near that at which on the right of the
French line, a strong body of infantry were pushing
forward with fixed bayonets against an earthwork
cresting the plateau, well defended by cannon. The
guns were thundering upon the advancing column
at the distance of about three hundred yards upon
my left, and the Austrian infantry were already
within a hundred paces of the steep ascent, along
the face of which my path led toward the town. I
was myself upon a pinnacle of the hill, a little above
either party, and my only chance of making my
way forward, was by taking a leap of some ten
feet down, to a spot where a <span class='it'>sapin</span> started from the
bold rock, and thence by a small circuit, getting
into the rear of the Austrian infantry. It was a
rash attempt; for if I missed my footing on the roots
of the tree, I was sure to be dashed to pieces; and
I was somewhat incumbered by my rifle. I took
the risk, however, and succeeded; and then hurried
forward as fast as I could go. But now a new
danger was before me—to say nothing of the murderous
fire from the French battery—for by the time
I had reached the point from which I could best pass
into the suburb, the Austrian infantry had been repulsed
for the moment, and were retreating in great
confusion. I know not how to describe my feelings
at that moment—afraid I certainly was not; but I
felt my head turn with the wild bustle and indistinct
activity of the scene. A number of men passed me,
running in utter disarray. An officer galloped after
them, shouting and commanding, for some time, in
vain. At length, however, he succeeded in rallying
them, just as I was passing along. The moment
they were once more formed, he turned his eyes to
the front, where another regiment, or part of a regiment,
had been already rallied, and seeing me at
some forty yards distance, he spurred on and asked
me, in German, whether there was a way up the
steep to the left of the line. Luckily, I spoke the
language fluently, and replied that there was, pointing
out to him the path by which I usually descended.
Without paying any further attention to me, he
hurried back to the head of his corps, and I ran on
as fast as possible to get out of the way of the next
charge. There was a little bridge which I had to
pass, where not more than four or five men could
go abreast, and over it a small body of Austrians
were forcing their way, at the point of the bayonet,
against a somewhat superior party of the French
troops, who, in fact, were willing enough to retreat,
seeing that a considerable impression had been made
upon their right, and that they were likely to be cut
off. At the same time, however, they would not
be driven back without resistance, and several men
fell. I followed impulsively the rear of the Austrians,
where I observed one or two of the Swiss
hunters appareled very much like myself, who were
using their rifles, with deadly effect, amongst the
officers of the Republican army; nor was it to be
wondered at, after all that had happened. I could
not, however, bring myself to give any assistance,
and kept my gun under my arm, with the belt twisted
round my wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the bridge was forced, the Austrians
debouched upon the ground beyond with greater
rapidity and precision than the French seemed to
expect; and while their right retreated in tolerable
order toward the heights, their left scattered in confusion,
and sought refuge in the suburbs of the town.
I took the same direction, and the first little street I
entered was so crowded with fugitives, comprising
a number of the townspeople, who, looking forth to
see the battle, had been taken by surprise on the
sudden rush of the French soldiers in that direction,
that it was impossible to pass; and although I saw
a sort of tumult going on before me, and heard a
gun or two fire, I turned away down the first narrow
street, only eager to be with my good preceptor, who
lived in a little street beyond the third turning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I entered that street, the sun, a good deal
declined, poured straight down it, and I could see
two or three groups of not more than two or three
persons in each, with the dress of the Republican
French soldier conspicuous here and there. I ran on
eagerly, and passed three persons all apparently
struggling together. One was a woman, another a
French soldier, and the third, who had his back toward
me, so that I could not see his face, was endeavoring
to protect the woman from violence, and
seemed to me, in figure, very like Lavater. I should
have certainly stopped to aid him; but there was
another scene going on a little in advance, which
left me no time to think of any thing else; but the
moment I had passed, I heard a shot behind me, and
then a deep groan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave it no thought; for within a stone’s throw
I beheld an old man whose face and figure I knew
well, brutally assaulted by one of the soldiers, and
falling on his knees, under a blow from the butt-end
of a musket. The next instant, the soldier—if such
a brute deserved the name—drew back the weapon,
and ere I could have reached the spot, the bayonet
would have been through Father Bonneville’s body.
I sent a messenger of swifter pace to stop the deed.
In an instant the rifle was at my shoulder, and before
I well knew that I touched the trigger, the Frenchman
sprang more than a foot from the ground, and
fell dead with the ball through his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I paused not to think—to ask myself what I had
done—to consider what it is to take a human life, or
to fight against one’s countrymen. I only thought
of good, kind, gentle Father Bonneville, and springing
forward, I raised him from the ground. He was
bleeding from the blow on the forehead, but did not
seem much hurt, and only bewildered and confused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick, into the house, good Father,” I cried.
“Shut the lower windows and lock the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my son, my son!” he exclaimed, looking
at me wildly, “do not mingle in this strife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lavater is behind,” I said; “I must hasten to
help him. Go in, and I will join you in an instant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you do that?” he inquired, looking at the
dead soldier, and then at the rifle in my hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” I answered, in a firmer tone than might
have been expected, “and he deserved his fate.
But go in, dear Father. I will return in a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I led him toward the door as I spoke, and saw
him enter the house; and then ran up the street to
the spot where I had seen the struggle I have mentioned.
Two dead bodies were lying on the pavement.
One was that of a young woman of the lower
class, fallen partly on her side, with a bayonet-wound
in the chest. The other was that of a man dressed
in black, who had fallen forward on his face. I
turned him over, and beheld the features of Lavater;
I took his hand, and the touch showed me that death
was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had knelt while doing this, when a sudden sound
made me attempt to rise—but I could not do so; for,
while still upon my knee, I was struck by the feet
of two or three men, cast back upon the ground, and
trampled under foot by a number of Austrians in full
flight. Every thing became dark and confused. I
saw the long gaiters, and caught a glance of arms
and accoutrements, and felt heavy feet set upon my
chest, and on my head—and then all was night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the weather was hot, and summer at its
height, in that high mountain region the night was
almost invariably cool. Probably that circumstance
saved my life; for I must have remained, I know,
several hours on the pavement untended, and perhaps
unnoticed by any one. When I recovered my
senses, it was nearly midnight, and then I found
several good souls around me. One woman was
bathing my head and chest with cold water, while a
man supported my shoulders upon his knee. The
first objects I saw, however, were three or four persons
moving the body of the woman, near whom I
had fallen, to a small hand-bier. The body of Lavater
was already gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, look, he opens his eyes!” cried the woman
who was tending me so kindly. “Poor lad!
we shall get him round! Where will you be taken
to, young man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I named faintly the house where we lodged, and
then another woman, who was standing by, exclaimed,
“Heaven! it is young Lassi! Better take
him to the hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I tried in vain to inquire after Father Bonneville;
for a faint, death-like sensation came over me, and
I was obliged to let them do what they pleased with
me. A blanket was soon procured, and placed in it,
as in a hammock, I was carried up into the higher
part of the town to the hospital, and there laid upon
a bed, in a ward where some hundreds of wounded
men were already congregated. A surgeon, with
his hands bloody, an apron on, and a saw under his
arm, soon came to me, and asked where I was
wounded. I endeavored to answer, but could not
make myself intelligible; and putting down the saw,
he ordered me to be stripped, and examined me all
over. Two of my ribs, it seemed had been broken,
and my head terribly beaten about. Indeed, I was
one general bruise. But my limbs were all sound,
and in four or five days, although I suffered a great
deal of pain, and the scenes which were going on
around me were not calculated to revive the spirits
of any one, I was sufficiently recovered to make inquiries
for Father Bonneville, whenever I saw a
new face, and to send a message for him to the house
where we lodged, giving him notice that I was to be
found at the hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Bonneville himself did not appear, but our
landlord came in his stead—a good, plain, honest
man, of a kindly disposition. He told me, much to
my consternation, that my good friend, as he called
him, had been carried off as a prisoner by the Austrians,
after they got possession of the town; that
he was suspected of being one of the French Revolutionary
Agents, and that most likely he would
have been hanged at once, without the testimony of
himself, our landlord, who had come forward to
prove that he was a quiet, inoffensive man, who
meddled not with politics in any shape, and would
have gladly got out of the town, after the French
occupation, had it been possible. This saved his life
for the time; but the only favor that could be obtained
was that the case should be reserved for
further investigation. At the time he was carried
away, Father Bonneville was perfectly ignorant of
my fate, the landlord said, and feared that I had been
killed. The good man, however, promised that he
would make every inquiry for my friend, and urged
me, in the meantime, to have myself carried to his
house as soon as possible. For more than a fortnight,
during which time I was unable to quit the
hospital, he came every day to see me, but brought
no intelligence of Father Bonneville. At length he
had me removed to his own house, and there he, and
his good old wife, attended upon me with great kindness
till I was quite well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as I could move about, the landlord told
me that Monsieur Charlier, as he called him, had left
with him a hundred louis d’ors for me, in case of my
return. “And lucky he did so,” added the old
gentleman, “for the Austrians ransacked every thing
in both your rooms, upon the pretence of searching
for papers, and left not a bit of silver worth a batz
that they could lay their hands upon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Days passed—weeks, and yet no tidings could be
obtained of good Father Bonneville; and thus was
I left, ere I had reached the age of nineteen, to
make a way for myself in life, with a small store
of clothing, a few books, a ride, and one hundred
louis.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>We</span> have had lying on our table, for some years,
this beautiful edition of Milton’s Select Prose
Works, and we have often, while reading it, resolved
to set about that which we have at last
attempted. But we have been deterred not more
by the importance of the subject, than by the recollection
of the great spirits who have already earned
rich harvests of applause in this field. The article
by Mr. Macaulay, published in the Edinburgh Review,
would seem to forbid further comment, where
the critic has left his reader in doubt which most to
admire, the splendor of his criticism, or the lofty
grandeur of his original. Then, too, Mr. St. John,
the editor of these neat and elegant volumes, has
given a preliminary discourse, which displays a keen
and warm admiration for these writings, expressed,
in a fervid strain of noble eloquence, which inspires
that gentle apprehension for the “bright countenance
of truth,” so soothing “in the quiet and still air of
delightful studies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a fine London edition of the Prose Works of
John Milton, published in the year 1838, there is a
well written review by the editor, Mr. Robert
Fletcher, in which he laments that some effort had
not before been made to “popularize, in a <span class='it'>multum
in parvo</span> shape, the prose works of our great poet.”
We have here an edition that completes his desires;
an edition in which great judgment has been exercised
in selecting, from various tracts, those portions
likely to prove most agreeable to the public. While
they give a proper conception of the opinions of
Milton, they also contain some of the purest specimens
of his style. Indeed, we think that some one
of our own publishing houses would find it to their
interest to bring out an edition of this work. The
nice taste and the correct discrimination displayed
in this selection would command for it a ready sale.
It would be of great use to many, who know nothing
of these writings, and of service to some, who, while
they know of them, yet neglect and turn away from
these rich well-springs of truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like all great messengers, Milton was, while
living, persecuted, and since his death has been the
object of malignant hatred, by those whose place of
abiding is fast by the “seat of the scorner.” He
whose “words are oracles for mankind, whose love
embraces all countries, and whose voice sounds
through all ages,” has been slighted, misrepresented,
abused, and reviled by those whose greatest glory
should have been, that they were the countrymen
of Milton—not Milton the poet—but Milton the
statesman. He who wielded a pen that made Europe
quake, and perpetuated political truths based
upon eternal justice—truths that were to warm and
kindle up mankind forever after in the pursuit of
right against might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before we approach these fountains of living light,
let us turn and see how it was that he, who had
been educated in seclusion, and mingled with the
scholars, the gentle and well-bred in his youth, did
desert all, and peril his life in the wild tumult and
hot strife of religious and political dissension, only
that he might bear witness to the light that was in
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Milton was the son of John Milton, a scrivener
of good repute, in the city of London. He was
born in the year 1608, and was carefully educated
under the supervision of his father, who was a man
of refined taste. He was destined for the Church,
and gave great promise of eminence; for he was an
assiduous and diligent youth, and was noted for his
complete learning and elegant scholarship, at the
University of Cambridge, where he obtained his degrees.
But he declined to take orders, and refused
to subscribe to the articles of faith, considering that
so doing was subscribing, slave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In thus early displaying his independence of
opinion in his religious belief, he did but follow the
example set him by his father, while he obeyed the
honest impulse of his nature; for his father had been
disinherited by his grandfather for deserting the Roman
Catholic faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after he left the University he retired into
the country with his father, who had then relinquished
business with a handsome estate; and while
there he continued his studies, selecting no particular
profession, but devoting himself to the cultivation
of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in these years of sweet scholastic solitude,
that he produced his Mask of Comus, than which
there is not a nobler poem in any language. This
brought him great fame among the polite and refined
of the day, and was widely circulated for a while in
manuscript; so that when he started on his travels
soon after this, (which was in 1638,) he carried with
him letters commanding, in his behalf, attention
from the most eminent men of the Continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went first to France, and while in Paris was
introduced by Lord Scudamore, the English ambassador,
to Hugo Grotius, with whom he had a very
interesting interview. From Paris he went into
Italy, and coming to Florence, in that city he mingled
freely with the refined and learned, and, by the
elegant displays of his own accomplishments and
learning, won the admiration and regard of all. The
scholars and wits of that place vied with one another
in entertaining him, and celebrated his many merits
in their compositions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With many of those brilliant spirits of that favored
land he formed an intimacy, which was continued
for years after his return home, as we find by his
familiar letters. From Florence he traveled to
Rome, and was there again treated with marked
kindness and attention by Lucas Holstensius, the
librarian of the Vatican, the Cardinal Barberino, and
other persons of distinction in that famous city.
From Rome he proceeded to Naples, and there
made the friendship of the Marquis of Villa, a man
of “singular merit and virtue,” and who was afterward
celebrated by Milton in a poem, as he had been
by Tasso, in his Jerusalem Delivered, and his Dialogue
on Friendship. Happy and fortunate lot!
thus to be the object of regard, and to have his
merits recorded, and his virtues enshrined, for the
admiration of posterity, in the works of these great
poetic minds!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had intended, after having thus visited the
finest parts of Italy, to go over into Sicily, and
thence to Greece; but the news from England of the
difficulties between the Parliament and the King
changed his mind, and he determined to return
home, to mingle with his countrymen in their toil
for freedom, thinking it unworthy of him to be loitering
away his time in luxurious ease, while his
native land was distracted, and his fellow men at
home were battling in fierce strife for liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned to Rome, notwithstanding the desire
of his friends that he should remain away; for by the
freedom of his speech when there he had aroused
the vindictive feelings of many of his hearers. And
to this he was no doubt provoked by having himself
seen the dreadful persecution undergone in the prison
of the Inquisition, by one of the finest scientific
minds the world ever knew—by Galileo—whom he
visited when imprisoned for asserting the motion of
the earth, and opposing the old notions of the Dominicans
and Franciscans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Rome he went to Florence; and after being
there a while he went to Venice, and from that port
he shipped his books and music for England. He
then took his route by Verona and Milan, and along
the lake of Leman to Geneva; and thence he returned
through France the same way he came, and
arrived safe in England after an absence of one year
and three months, “having seen more, learned more,
and conversed with more famous men, and made
more real improvement than most others in double
the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return home, he again devoted himself to
the solitude of his study, and to the teaching of
several youths (among whom were his nephews)
who were intrusted to his care; and in his own
house he formed quite an academic institute, where
his scholars, like the disciples of the philosophers of
old, gathered around him, and by assiduity added to
their stores of knowledge, while with his advice
and counsel they were purifying and elevating their
feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1641, the nation was in great ferment
with the religious disputes of the day, which were
intimately connected with the chief political questions
then agitated. This roused Milton, who was
alive to the close association of the two subjects;
and for the furtherance of his political designs, the
support of liberty, he issued a powerful tract upon
Prelatical Episcopacy. This served to work out a
good end, and strengthen the cause of the liberalists.
For this, as for other reasons of a like nature, he
was prompted to write several other polemical
tracts, during that year, and then he dropped the
subject forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1643 he married, being then thirty-five years
old. After a month his wife, by his permission,
went to visit her relations; and when sent for by
him—for reasons which are as yet unexplained—she
refused to return, and dismissed his messenger with
contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was deeply wounded by this treatment, and
maintained toward her a dignified and resolute indifference.
Mortified, and full of sorrow, he found
relief in the contemplation of his very source of wo;
and after reflection upon it, he projected and published
his work upon Divorce, which is to this day
one of the most famous works on the subject ever
printed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Affairs had now assumed a new aspect, and the
Presbyterian party had, after a great struggle with
Royalty, gained the ascendency, and then ruled supreme
in the councils of the nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King and his abettors were fighting in the
field for that authority, they had before vainly endeavored
to establish with the arm of civil power.
The Presbyterians were now in their day of prosperity;
they had been oppressed but were now triumphant.
Adversity had not been of use to them.
They did not learn charity, or humanity, from her
lessons, but now exercised authority with a lordly
air, and wielded the sword of State with presumptuous
arrogance. Among other acts of great inconsistency
and oppression, they established a supervision
of the press under the control of an authorized
licenser, and at the same time endeavored to suppress
the freedom of speech. This base desertion
of the principles for which they had contended, this
mean exercise of authority in that, in which they had
suffered the most, and against which they had clamored
the loudest, excited Milton to the writing of
the Areopagitica. This pamphlet was written by
him upon this shameful abuse. He had before acted
in concert with them, as the movement party of the
day; but when they abandoned and treasonably betrayed
the rights of Man, they left him where he had
always been, standing on the rock of truth fast by
his principles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is not a nobler vindication of the freedom
of speech, and the liberty of the press, to be found
any where, than in this pamphlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This book was published in 1644, and in this year
he was reconciled to his wife, who sought him out,
and unexpectedly to him fell at his feet, and with
tears besought his love and forgiveness. In this, as
in other instances, have we a strong evidence of the
mildness and gentleness of his feelings; for although
his resentment had been aroused by her wicked
abandonment of him, yet when she returned home,
repentant and in sorrow, he joyfully received her,
and forgave all. Nay more, when defeat and route
had fallen upon the royal standard, he generously
took home her father, and his whole family—who
were attached to the cause of the monarchy—protected
them during the heat of his party triumph,
and finally interested himself to secure their estates
from confiscation, although they had in their days
of prosperity prompted his wife to her disobedience
and desertion of her republican husband; thus showing
a high-heartedness which was above malice,
and in keeping with and but a practical domestic
application of the pure, upright faith professed by him,
which was stern and unyielding in the pursuits of
right, but humane and gentle in the use of power
and advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was now an eminent man, and his bold pen
had won for him a public fame and name. About
this time he was well-nigh being swept into the
mid current of popular politics, and it was contemplated
making him the adjutant general, under
Sir William Waller; but this design was abandoned
upon the remodeling of the army, and he was left
at his studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king was imprisoned and tried, and then it
was that the true faith and intentions of many were
made clear. The Presbyterian party, who had
professed democratic republicanism, while their
hopes of office were high—like many in our own
days, who, when they have attained their hopes, or
been rejected by the people for better men, desert
their cause, abandon their principles, while they hold
on to their name, and fight under their old banners,
that they may more surely but more basely injure
truth—being now in the minority and out of power,
became noisy in their lamentations over the king’s
fate, and endeavored by every means to prevent his
execution, using all arguments, and stopping at nothing
to undo what they themselves had brought
about. For when they found that there was an unflinching
determination of the democracy to punish
this man for his enormities and wicked misgovernment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They who”—to use Milton’s language—“had
been fiercest against their prince, under the notion
of a tyrant, and no mean incendiaries of the war
against him, when God out of his providence and
high disposal hath delivered him into the hands of
their brethren, on a sudden and in a new garb of
allegiance, which their doings have long since concealed,
they plead for him, pity him, extol him, and
protest against those who talk of bringing him to
the trial of justice, which is the sword of God,
superior to all mortal things, in whose hand soever,
by apparent signs, his testified will is to put it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the happening of this event, Milton published
his “Tenure of Kings,” from which is quoted
the above passage, so applicable in its spirit to our
own times, so true of all political trucksters, who
shout loudly for the democracy, while they have
hopes of using and abusing it, but who basely betray
its confidence and abandon it, whenever they are
required to put in practice their own professions.
This book was published 1649, and served very
much to tranquilize and calm the public mind upon
that which had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the establishment of the Commonwealth, he
was called to the post of Latin Secretary, by the
Council of State, which station he held till the Restoration.
This was an office of great importance,
inasmuch as all the public correspondence with
foreign States devolved upon him. While holding
this high and honorable public station, one so congenial
with his feelings, and one for which he was
so well fitted, he produced many state papers of
great merit, and which contributed to advance the
fame of the republic abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the execution of Charles Stuart, there was published
a book which was styled “Eikōn Basilikē,”
and which was pretended to have been written by
the king, and left by him as a legacy and parting
word to the world. It had a most unprecedented
sale, owing to the curiosity excited by its appearance.
As it was a work which was then likely to
excite public sympathy, when public sympathy
would be thrown away upon a bad and unworthy
object, while at the same time it would abuse and
mislead the public mind, the Parliament called upon
Milton to write an answer to it, and to furnish an
antidote for this lying poison, which it is well believed
was never written by the king, but was
manufactured and industriously circulated by the
enemies of the people, and the friends of arbitrary
power, with a hope that by its means they could
unsettle the public mind, weaken the republic, and
reëstablish the tyranny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milton accordingly wrote his <a id='eikon1'></a>Eikonoklastes; and
truly was he an image-breaker; for with merciless
force he entered the temple, and with his own right
arm shattered the idol that they had bid all mankind
bow down before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles the Second, who was then residing upon
the Continent, hired Salmasius, a man of great
learning, and the successor of the celebrated Scaliger,
as honorary professor at Leyden, to write a work in
defense of his father and of the monarchy. For
this work Charles paid Salmasius one hundred jacobuses.
In the execution of this book, Salmasius
filled it pretty plentifully with insolent abuse of all
the public men of the Commonwealth, and those
prominent in the Revolution; both from a natural
inclination, and according to directions. In this he
was quite expert; for though he was a fine scholar
and very famed for his learning, yet as it has been
said of him—“This prince of scholars seemed to
have erected his throne upon a heap of stones, that
he might have them at hand to throw at every one’s
head who passed by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately upon the appearance of this book, the
Council of State unanimously selected Milton to answer
it; and he, in obedience to this call, prepared
and published his Defense of the People of England,
a work of great worth and power, and which was
written at intervals, during the moments snatched
from his official duties, when he was weakened and
infirm. This book was read everywhere. Europe
rang with it, and wonder at its force filled all minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By some it has been said that the Council presented
him with £1000 as a reward, which was no
mean sum in those days of specie circulation. But
empty thanks were all that he received. Neither
this nor any other of his writings ever obtained one
cent for him from the public purse, as he asserts in
his Second Defense. While Milton was thus receiving
attentions from all quarters, it was much
otherwise with his arrogant opponent; for he suffered
not only by the severity of Milton’s reply, but
was slighted and treated ill by Christiana, Queen of
Sweden, who had invited him to her court, among
other learned men. Upon the reading of Milton’s
“Defense,” she was so delighted therewith, that
her opinion of Salmasius changed, and she became
indifferent to him, which he perceiving, left her
court, and retired to Spa, in Germany, where he
shortly after died of chagrin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milton had been for many years suffering from a
weakness in his eyes, arising out of his severe application
to his studies. Year after year his sight
became more and more dim, until his physicians
warned him that unless he ceased his continual toil,
he would become totally blind. This for a while
he heeded; but the urgent call made upon him in
the production of this answer to Salmasius, led him
again to over-application, and he became wholly
blind. Notwithstanding his blindness, he still continued
the discharge of his official duties, and employed
his leisure moments in the production of
various other political tracts, in answer to the many
abusive works issued by the royalists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the death of Oliver Cromwell, and the taking
place of the difficulties that followed, he wrote a
“Letter to a Statesman,” [supposed to be General
Monk,] in which he gave a brief delineation of a
“free Commonwealth, easy to be put in practice, and
without delay.” Finding affairs were growing worse
and worse, the people more and more unsettled, and
that a king was likely to be reëstablished, and the
Commonwealth subverted, he wrote and published
his “Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth,
and the Excellence thereof, Compared
with the Inconveniences and Dangers of admitting
Kingship in this Nation.” This short paper was
published in 1659-60, and even after this he published
his “Notes on a late Sermon entitled the
Fear of God and the King, preached at Mercer’s
Chapel, on March 25th, 1660, by Dr. Matthew
Griffith,” the very year, and within a month of the
Restoration; so that his voice was the last to bear witness
against the overthrow of liberty and the restoration
of tyranny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the return of Charles, he fled, and lay concealed,
during which time his books, the <a id='eikon2'></a>Eikonoklastes
and “Defense of the People of England,” were
burned by the common hangman! An indictment
was found against him, and a warrant for his
arrest placed in the hands of the sergeant-at-arms.
The act of indemnity was passed, and he received
the benefit of it, and came forth from his concealment,
but was arrested, and shortly after, by order
of the House of Commons, discharged, upon his
paying the fees to the sergeant-at-arms, who had
endeavored to exact them from him, which he
resisted, and appealed to the House. And thus,
although a prisoner, he still displayed a determination
and resolution to oppose that oppression in his
own person, against which he had so stoutly battled
for the whole people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He now retired from public life forever; and when
an offer was afterward made to him by the king, to
return to his old post of secretary, he refused it,
although pressed by his wife to accept it, and to her
entreaties answered thus: “Thou art in the right;
you and other women would ride in your coach;
for me, my aim is to live and die an honest man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This offer has been denied by Doctor Johnson, in
his life of Milton, and that, too, without sufficient
foundation, for the contradiction is made without
proof; and when Dr. Newton, in his admirable account
of Milton, published in his splendid edition of
the Poetical Works of Milton, confirms it, and
asserts that these very words were from Milton’s
wife only twenty years before the publication of his
edition. The Doctor has in this, as in other instances,
displayed a malicious desire to detract from
his merits; his envy no doubt being excited by this
unbending integrity of one, whose political opinions
were serious enough in the Doctor’s eyes to affect
even his merits as a poet. For this, as for other
offenses, has he received again and again that censure
which he so richly deserved; but from no one
with more force than from Mr. St. John, in his
able Preliminary Discourse to these volumes. We
quote a passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another sore point with Johnson was, that
Milton should be said to have rejected, after the
Restoration, the place of Latin Secretary to Charles
the Second. Few men heartily believe in the existence
of virtue above their own reach. He knew
what he would have done under similar circumstances;
he knew that had he lived during the period
of the Commonwealth, a similar offer from the Regicides
would have met with no ‘sturdy refusal’
from him; he knew it was in his eyes no sin to accept
of a pension from one whom he considered an
usurper; how, then, could he believe, what must
have humiliated him in his own esteem, that the
old blind republican, bending beneath the weight of
years and indigence, still cherished heroic virtues in
his soul, and spurned the offer of a tyrant! Oh, but
he had filled the same office under Oliver Cromwell!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milton regarded ‘Old Noll’ as a greater and
better ‘Sylla,’ to whom, in the motto to his work
against the restoration of kingship, he compares
him, and evidently hoped to the last, what was
always, perhaps, intended by the Protector, and understood
between them, that as soon as the troubles
of the times should be properly appeased, he would
establish the Republic. In this Milton consented
to serve with him, not to serve him; for Cromwell
always professed to be the servant of the people.
And after all, there was some difference between
Cromwell and Charles the Second. With the
former the author of Paradise Lost had something
in common; they were both great men, they
were both enemies to that remnant of feudal barbarism,
which, supported by prejudice and ignorance,
had for ages exerted so fatal an influence over
the destinies of their country. Minds of such an
order—in some things, though not in all, resembling—might
naturally enough coöperate; for they could
respect each other. But with what sense of decorum,
or reverence for his own character, remembering
the glorious cause for which he had struggled,
could Milton have reconciled his conscience to
taking office under the returned Stuart, to mingle
daily with the crowd of atheists who blasphemed
the Almighty, and with swinish vices debased his
Image in the polluted chambers of Whitehall. The
poet regarded them with contemptuous abhorrence;
and, if I am not exceedingly mistaken, described
them under the names of devils, in the court of their
patron and inspirer below. Besides, even had they
possessed the few virtues compatible with servitude,
it would have been a matter of constant chagrin, of
taunt and reviling on one side, and silent hatred on
the other, to have brought together republican and
slave in the same bureau, and to have compelled a
democratic pen to mould correct phrases for a despicable
master. So far, however, was the biographer
from comprehending the character of the man whose
life he undertook to write, that he seems to have
thought it an imputation on him, and a circumstance
for which it is necessary to pity his lot, that the dissolute
nobles of the age seldom resorted to his humble
dwelling! The sentiment is worthy of Salmasius.
But was there then living a man who would
not have been honored by passing under the shadow
of that roof? by listening to the accents of those inspired
lips? by being greeted and remembered by
him whose slightest commendation was immortality?
Elijah, or Elisha, or Moses, or David, or Paul of
Tarsus, would have sat down with Milton and found
in him a kindred spirit. But the slave of Lady Castlemain,
or the traitor Monk, or Rochester, or the
husband of Miss Hyde, or that Lord Chesterfield,
who saw what Hamilton describes, and dared not
with his sword revenge the insult, might forsooth
have thought it a piece of condescension to be seen
in the Delphic Cavern in England, whence proceeded
those sacred verses which in literature have raised her
above all other nations, to the level of Greece herself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon his release from arrest he retired to the obscurity
and solitude of his own dwelling, where he
passed his time in the composition of his Paradise
Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes.
During this time he also produced a History of Britain,
with several other prose works. In 1674 he
expired, worn out with illness and a life of toil; he
died without a groan, and so gentle and placid was
his departure, that they who were round him did not
perceive it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although all of his political writings were called
forth by the events that were passing before him,
and were for that reason local in their immediate
application, yet they are so catholic and elemental in
their spirit, that we can hardly believe that they
were written in an age when feudal tenures were
not abolished, and before any people had as yet secured
their own freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His Areopagitica was his first political work; and
although it was written for a special purpose, and
with a view to a then existing evil, it is still a
pamphlet that might very well be published at this
day, as the declaration of our opinions upon this subject
of the liberty of the press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very motto of the book, taken from Euripides,
and translated by himself, indicates the whole spirit
and intent of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After discussing the real merits of the question
then before him, he departs altogether from that
topic; and as he always did, generously claimed the
same right for mankind, that he had sought for Englishmen.
And then it is he utters this fine sentence,
which shows a noble enthusiasm in his cause, and a
firm belief in its justice. “Give me the liberty to
know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience
above <span class='it'>all liberties</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this work he wrote his “Tenure of Kings.”
The design of this pamphlet has been already explained.
We may judge of its liberal character by these
few passages. At first he alludes to the treasonable
desertion of principles by those, who were then turbulent
for the king’s release, and who had mainly
helped to provoke and carry on the war. Afterward
he declares this general principle; “No man, who
knows aught, can be so stupid as to deny that all men
naturally <span class='it'>were born free</span>, being the image and resemblance
of God himself.” And after this proclamation
of that essential truth, he proceeds to analyze the
history of society, and shows by reason, scriptural
authority, general history, and the universal opinions
of mankind, that all government proceeds from the
people, is created by them for their comfort and good,
and is subject to their control, whether it be patriarchal,
despotic, or aristocratic; and that no king or
potentate holds by any other authority than the consent
of the people; which being withdrawn his rule
ceases, and for his crimes his life may be forfeited—declaring
that this must be so, “unless the people
must be thought created all for him singly, which
were a kind of treason against the dignity of mankind
to affirm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after all this he shows his charity for his fellow
men, wherever they may be, by saying, “Who
knows not that there is a mutual bond of amity and
brotherhood between man and man all over the
world; neither is it the English sea that can sever
us from that duty and relation.” It is this sentiment,
and such like this, that demands of us our admiration
and regard for this purest of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same manner does he fight the same fight in
his <a id='eikon3'></a>Eikonoklastes, and “Defense of the English People,”
fearlessly breaking new ground in behalf of the
“Rights of Man,” as if he considered it to be his
greatest glory to be the champion of his race, while
he was defending his countrymen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Eikonoklastes, after refuting the many lies
uttered by the king’s lip-workers, he says, “It is
my determination that through me the truth shall be
spoken, and not smothered, but sent abroad in her
native confidence of her single self, to earn how she
can her entertainment in the world, and to find out
her own readers.” Hearken then again to his
words, which now, near two hundred years after
they were published, come like a solemn and prophetic
voice from out the writings of the old, blind
republican.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men are born and created with a better title to
their freedom, than any king hath to his crown.
And liberty of person and right of self-preservation
is much nearer, and more natural, and more worth
to all men than the property of their goods and
wealth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is <span class='it'>our</span> truth, the corner-stone of our faith.
Here we stand, and alone of nations have made this
our practice, and thereby given a healthful example
to all men. These things he believed, and, for the
first time for ages, did he announce to the world
those truths which were to unsettle tyranny and
open the way to universal freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the king was about to return, he published
“The Mode of Establishing a Free Commonwealth.”
This was the last blast blown to rouse the people
from their lethargy. With a prophetic energy did
he predict the ills that would fall upon the nation,
should the king again be established. How sadly
have his words been realized in the gilded misery
that now surrounds his country, where starving
millions toil like beasts of the field to fatten a licentious
and debased aristocracy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this book he told the people that “no government
was nearer the precepts of Christ than a free
Commonwealth, wherein they who are the greatest
are perpetual servants to the public, and yet are not
elevated above their brethren, live soberly in their
families, walk the streets as other men, may be
spoken to freely, familiarly, friendly, without adoration.”
After extolling the excellent beauty of freedom,
and exhorting them to stand by their rights, he
thus concludes, with these passages so full of grand
and pathetic eloquence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no more to say at present; few words
will save us, well considered; few and easy things,
now seasonably done. But if the people be so affected
as to prostitute religion and liberty to the vain
and groundless apprehension, that nothing but Kingship
can restore trade, not remembering the frequent
plagues and pestilences that then wasted this city,
such as through God’s mercy we never have felt
since; and that trade flourishes nowhere more than
in the free Commonwealths of Italy, Germany, and
the Low Countries, before their eyes at this day;
yet if trade be grown so craving and importunate,
through the <span class='it'>profuse living of tradesmen</span>, that nothing
can support it but the luxurious expenses of a
nation upon trifles or superfluities, so as if the people
generally should betake themselves to frugality, it
might prove a dangerous matter, lest tradesmen
should mutiny for want of trading; and that therefore
we must forego, and set to sale religion, liberty,
honor, safety, all concernments, divine or human, to
keep up trading. What I have spoken is the language
of that which is not called amiss, “The Good
Old Cause;” it seem strange to any, it will not
seem more strange, I hope, than convincing to back-sliders.
Thus much I should perhaps have said,
though I was sure I should have spoken only to
trees and stones, and had none to cry to, but with
the prophet, ‘O Earth, Earth, Earth!’ to tell the
very soil itself what her perverse inhabitants are
deaf to; nay, though what I have spoke should happen,
[which Thou suffer not, who didst create mankind
free! nor Thou next who didst redeem us from
being the servants of men!] to be the last words of
our expiring liberty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The political works of this great man have been
diligently suppressed, and his political fame traduced;
while they, who could not deny him merit,
have been busy before the world in lauding him as a
poet, thinking thus to lead men off from a knowledge
of that wherein consisted his true greatness. We
question much whether the dullest mind could read
these books now, without being roused and filled
with enthusiasm for this apostle of liberty, and for
his cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In them he nobly vindicates the people and their
rights. “The Good Old Cause,” as he calls it,
warms him up, and he writes with an exulting
energy that would make your blood gush with delight.
His opinions were not the distempered
thoughts of a factionist. He never allowed his
feelings to be warped by a selfish regard for party
advancement. He knew no party, but generously
devoted his whole soul to the cause of his country,
and in defense of the rights of mankind. In his old
age his greatest glory was, that he had always written
and spoken openly in defense of liberty and against
slavery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truths which he wrote in his matured years,
as applying to the condition of his unfortunate country,
were but repetitions of the faith of his youth, as
he had powerfully expressed it in his Comus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even now, while we conclude these few pages
our pen falters, and we feel disposed to abandon the
task. His magnificence overpowers us. How can
we point out the excellence of that which commands
the admiration of all men, and is beyond the loftiest
praise of the most eloquent? Again and again have
we turned over the leaves of this work, with the intention
of selecting passages worthy of comment and
regard, and so thickly have they flowed in upon us,
that page after page has been exhausted, and we had
not finished. How idle, then, to select from these
masterpieces of eloquence and storehouses of truth!
How vain to dwell upon his merits, when every line
of his splendid composition tells of his measureless
learning and infinite purity of thought. His style, at
once grand and simple, is happily suited to convey
conviction to the mind, and inspire the soul with fervid
energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While his works are filled with noble conceptions,
clothed in language of corresponding state and grandeur,
we nowhere find any attempt at fine rhetoric
for mere empty display. The whole subject sweeps
on with solemn magnificence, but with no idle pomp.
From the depths of his soul did he speak, and his
words were as fire, scorching to his enemies, and
life-giving and cheering to those who love “truth
and wisdom, not respecting numbers and big names.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most inspiring view that can be taken of the
soul of these writings is, that they are, even at this
day, far in advance of the social condition that exists
in this land of liberal and enlightened principles of
government. The precepts by which he would wish
us to be guided, are the pure and humane doctrines
of the Savior of man. He did not fight only for the
liberties of <span class='it'>Englishmen</span>, contending for <span class='it'>English</span>
rights, citing the charters of <span class='it'>English</span> liberty—no,
not he—all mankind were alike to him, and for <span class='it'>man</span>
alone he spake. No such Hebrew spirit animated
his noble soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He proclaimed the rights of man, as man, and asserted
his rights, natural and social, without ever
launching out into Utopian speculations and visionary
conceptions, the practical utility of which no one
can affirm, and the application of which would have
worked out ills innumerable, rooting up and overthrowing
ten thousand times ten thousand social
rights, that had grown up with the state itself. He
asserted abstractions; but with an intimate knowledge
of men and their affairs, he steadily avoided
violating those relative rights, to suddenly encroach
on which would have been even as great a despotism
as the rugged foot of feudal barbarity, with
which his country had been oppressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the generous and life-giving precepts of the
Gospel did he draw his faith. He there learned
charity for the misdoings of men, as well as belief in
their power to resist evil and attain truth. He there
learned love for mankind, as he imbibed a stern, unyielding
hate for tyranny and hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No timid navigator, skirting along the shores and
headlands, but a bold, adventurous spirit, he pushed
forth upon a wild, tempestuous sea of troubles, with
murky night of ignorance and superstition surrounding
him. The “Telemachus” of <a id='fen'></a>Fénelon, might
have been the “first dim promise of a great deliverance,
the undeveloped germ of the charter of the
code,” for the whole French people. But in these
writings of Milton, we have a <span class='it'>full</span> and manly assertion
of those rights and duties which all men owe
one to the other, and all to society, and which are
far, far beyond the simple truths conveyed in that
beautiful and easy fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well might the French monarch have “the Defense”
burned by the common hangman! Well
might he for whom “a million peasants starved to
build Versailles,” look down with horror and fear
upon that work, for in it were truths which have
roused up men to assert their rights. It was the vindication
of a noble people, who had trampled under
their feet the yoke that oppressed them, and had
brought to punishment the tyrant who reigned over
them. These works and the events that produced
them have an interest to us. Englishmen may slight
them, but we look on them with exultation—they
are associated with our own history—they are connected
with our own family legends—and as they
record the mighty struggle of the mighty with the
powers and principalities of this earth, they should
be reverenced and held sacred by us; they should be
our household companions, as they were of those
men whose blood now warms the hearts of an empire
of freemen, who boast their lineage from a
prouder source than kings—the Puritans of New
England. The men of that Revolution have never
been fully understood. He who would wish to know
the justice of their cause, let him read Milton, and
let him read the real documents of the times. They
have been abused and misrepresented by most historians.
Mr. Bancroft, in his History of his Country,
has comprehended these martyrs in the cause of democratic
rights, and dared to tell the truth concerning
them. They and theirs were the settlers of this
country. From them came the mighty forest of
sturdy oaks, which in years after were to breast the
storm of royal oppression and wrath, in this their refuge;
and from which tempest we—WE THE
PEOPLE, came out gloriously triumphant!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Think not ill of them. Tread lightly upon their
memories as you would upon their ashes. They
who perished upon the scaffold—they who found a
home here—they who died upon the field in England,
or worn out with anxiety and public care, sank
to rest forever in their homes—they who, like Cromwell,
fought in the field and ruled in the council—and
they who, like Milton, have proclaimed from
the study that “<span class='it'>man is free</span>,” have earned names
that time will brighten, and have stood by truths
that will secure the affections of a world hereafter.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>It was a summer morning. Soft the flame</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of the early sunlight up the zenith came,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Deep tinging with a golden-crimson hue</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The clouds that floated o’er the welkin blue,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or veiled the distant mountain. Far, and near,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From farm to farm the call of chanticleer</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Rang like a clarion, shrilly sweet and long,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The robin red-breast trilled his matin song,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Hid in the high old maple, while around</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From far, deep-waving grain-fields gayly sound</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The carols of the bob-o-link. The bee</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Was out among the blossoms, in his glee</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To rouse them from their dreamings. Gracefully</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The west-wind waved the weeping willow-tree</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That drooped above the rivulet, or crept</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Amid the branches of the elm that swept</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A low-browed homestead. Ruby columbine,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sweet honey-suckle, and the Indian vine,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Had veiled the rustic portico, and wild</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Swayed o’er the casement, and the sunlight smiled</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Through the low entrance. ’Twas a winsome place,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And like the sunny calm of some sweet face,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>You would have thought in gazing on its rest,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That earth’s frail children <span class='it'>sometimes</span> can be blest.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And yet misfortune found it;—see the group</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Now gathered at the threshold, o’er them droop</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Long, swaying branches, and the loving leaves</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lay their light fingers o’er the heart that grieves,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As if to soothe its sorrows. Agony</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lights up the darkness of the husband’s eye,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He stands apart, his bearing calm and proud,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And yet his heart is burning ’neath a cloud</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of dread and misery. The young wife leans</p>
<p class='dramaline'>By the old elm-tree, ’mid the passing scenes</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her heart is busy, for beside her stands</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A lovely child, with snowy, dimpled hands</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Clasping her mother’s, while within the shade</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her baby brother on the greensward played.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;The little maiden mused, a choking swell</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Filled her young bosom, and the large tears fell</p>
<p class='dramaline'>All silently, then her slow-lifting eyes</p>
<p class='dramaline'>(Their blue depths troubled with a strange surprise)</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sought out her mother’s;—tossing back her hair,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her clear voice melted on the morning air;—</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“We leave the homestead!—Say, dear mother, why?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Do not the birds and blossoms love us here?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Has any other home a clearer sky,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;With brighter stars upon it? Mother, dear,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Shall we not sigh <span class='it'>there</span> for this old elm shade,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where you and I and brother oft have played?</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“We leave the homestead!—Oh! my father, tell,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Why turn we from the fields, and wood-paths dim,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Through which we wended as the Sabbath bell</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Called us to worship, with its solemn hymn?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Shall we not sigh to pray where friends have prayed,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or weep our loved ones in the church-yard laid?”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>The haughty bosom of the strong man shook</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With an internal tempest, and he took</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her tiny hand within his own; his pride</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Was bending, and he earnestly replied:</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“Why do we leave it?—’tis a tale too long,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;And strange to fall upon <span class='it'>thy</span> heart, my child;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>’Twould tell of dark misfortunes, pain, and wrong,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;And wo, that seemed at times to drive me wild,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To make me doubt the path my fathers trod,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And that the poor man had indeed a God!</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“But thou, my Ada, true and gentle bride,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Looked first upon ‘Glenoran?’ All untried,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Am I myself its serpent and its bane,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To leave on all its bloom a deadly stain?</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“Oh! could I only bear this all alone,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;The grinding poverty—the lurking sneer—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>All the poor debtor’s wretchedness—no moan</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;My soul would utter audibly, but here</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My heart of hearts is crushed, my life of life,</p>
<p class='dramaline'><span class='it'>They</span> suffer also, child, and babe, and wife.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“We leave the homestead;—wanderers we go,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;From friends, from kindred, and our native land—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My God! if <span class='it'>I</span> have merited such wo,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Oh! let thy justice all my actions scan,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Yet leave one hope—to die an honest man.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>He drooped his head upon his bosom, bowed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With misery, and instantly the proud</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Young wife was at his side; soft o’er his brow</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Swept her white fingers, and her voice was low:</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“Thy soul is dark, beloved, it fears for us—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Ah! only trust in God, as I in thee,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lift up thy stately brow; to see thee thus</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Is worse than all life’s agony to me.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thou couldst have died for us, beloved, but we,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>E’en when all hope is lost, will live for thee.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>“They cannot separate our souls from thine,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;They cannot part us wheresoe’er we roam,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or place aught else within the sacred shrine,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Give me mine only <span class='it'>home</span> within thy heart—</p>
<p class='dramaline'><span class='it'>I’ll bear it with me</span>—let us hence depart.”</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>It is the summer twilight. Dark the shades</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Are falling through the forest everglades,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The winds are hushed, the lonely whip-poor-will</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sings his wild lullaby upon the hill,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A sighing murmur from the mountain-pines</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Steals up valley, and the love-star shines,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>All brightly in “Glenoran.”</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Glad tidings visited those bosoms torn</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With unavailing sorrow, now the “right”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To have a home was granted, and delight</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Was blended into orisons. That line</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Whose fiat echoes back a law divine,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>This</span> man came to Louisiana many years since, a
silver-smith by trade, poor, and largely in debt. He
was born in New York, and in that city worked industriously
at the business to which he had been apprenticed,
until a competency rewarded his labors,
and wealth, which he had before little thought of,
was brought near enough to his door to be both seen
and desired. The hammer, the soldering-iron, and
the file were now thrown aside, as instruments of a
slow getting; and the head was taxed with schemes
for the acquisition of sudden and great gains. At
the close of two years he was a bankrupt. But he
was not a man of half-measures; true courage he
had enough of; and honesty has never been denied
him; so, he called his creditors together, laid before
them a statement of his affairs, surrendered all that
he had, gave his notes for eighty thousand dollars,
and departed, with nerves unshaken, and a will indomitable,
in search of a new land and a new fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the ambition of wealth drew him from his
work-shop, he carefully laid aside the tools of his
trade in a stout oaken box, to be kept as mementoes
of former labor; they were now all that remained to
him, the only gift which he had asked, and would
receive of creditors who were disposed to be generous.
With them, at thirty-five years of age, he bid
the North good-bye, went on shipboard, entered before
the mast, in payment of a passage to New Orleans,
and on his arrival there, at once hired himself
into the service of a silver-smith, who has since
ranked with the wealthiest of its citizens, and who
has since met with ruin more disastrous than that
which brought the best of his journeymen to his
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Cornelius, when you first scented the Mississippi
marshes, and stepped from ship to shore with
a debt of eighty thousand dollars upon your back,
John Gravier had not wholly parted with that domain,
which now forms the noblest portion of the
second municipality. To one with a soul in his
body, bent on money-getting, the track clear, the
goal in view, to be won with effort, eighty thousand
dollars of debt is like weight to the race-horse—it is
not best to run too light at the start. Your eye saw
what John Gravier did not. You read the page
written by the hand of God, legibly enough—the
Mississippi with all its tributaries, rolling through
lands of an unequalled fertility, and of every variety
of clime, and you had faith. God’s promises are
certain. With the return of spring comes the
flower, and with the breath of autumn comes the
fruit; with the twinkling star comes rest, and with
the rise of day comes light and labor; every mountain,
every hill and valley, every plain and running-stream,
river and ocean, speak of God’s promises,
and accomplish them. Read, and understand; this
it is, which separates the man gifted from the common
herd, who are born to toil for the benefit of the
few.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Cornelius read God’s promises in the Mississippi,
and went heartily to work. With him, there
was no folding of the hands, no waiting on Providence;
for he knew that the fable of Hercules and the
wagoner was as instructive under a Christian, as
under a pagan dispensation; so he girded up his
loins, made sharp his sickle, and entered upon the
harvest which was already ripe for the reaper.
Economy is the handmaid of wealth, and penuriousness
is economy’s own daughter. John Cornelius
took them both to his bosom, and for ten long years
he lived upon one meal a day, and that a cold one.
The larger portion of his monthly wages he hoarded
up, and when the accumulations had become sufficient,
remembering the promises of the Mississippi,
he bought a lot of ground within the precincts of John
Gravier’s plantation; hoarded again, put a small
wooden tenement upon the lot, rented, and was a
landlord. Thus he went on, working, hoarding,
with economy and penuriousness his whole household,
penuriousness holding the upper hand; adding
lot to lot, tenement to tenement, and lease to lease,
until at the close of ten years, he found that God’s
promises written upon the Mississippi, were fulfilled
and fulfilling; and he again laid aside the tools of his
trade in a stout, oaken box, there to rest, as they do
rest to this hour. He was rich; he had kept even
pace with New Orleans, in its progress toward
greatness; but, with his wealth had grown up a
habit, the habit of penuriousness, which wealth only
strengthened, as a child strengthens its parent.
Habit moulds the soul, and fashions it to its will;
habit makes the writer; habit makes the poet;
of habit, are born the soldier, the statesman, and
the scholar; habit created the arts, and all science;
habit gives faith and religion, and fastens every vice
upon us; and habit made John Cornelius a miser.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was many years subsequent to the period at
which Mr. Cornelius found it for his interest to retire
a second time from the work-shop, and to devote
himself exclusively to the management of his increasing
rent-roll, and frequent investments in real
property, and when, with the eighty thousand dollars
of debt lifted from his shoulders, he stood erect,
mighty in wealth, that he one day entered my office,
and tendered me a counselor’s fee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cornelius and myself were strangers to each
other. I had occupied chambers in one of his houses
for the past five years, but his collector arranged
with me the terms of my lease, and received the
quarterly rent; and as my landlord was faithful to
his own interests, and as I was equally faithful to
mine, no incident had transpired, growing out of our
relations, to bring us together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have for some time been a tenant of yours,
Mr. Cornelius,” said I, handing the gentleman a
chair; “and I suppose that I may attribute this visit
to a worthy desire on your part to become acquainted
with one who, thus far, has exhibited no sign of an
intention to quit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am too old a man to wish for new acquaintances,
Mr. Didimus; and had you referred my call
to a knowledge of your reputation for attention to
business, and a want of your professional services,
you would have come much nearer the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thanked him, both for the compliment and his
confidence; and requested a statement of his case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time is money,” said Mr. Cornelius; “and a
few words shall not long detain either of us. In October
last, a Mr. Andrews died; my debtor to the
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars. The debt
is secured by mortgage upon his house; but his
widow comes in for twice the sum, in virtue of her
paraphernal rights, and as her claim is older than
mine, it will sweep away all, unless I can show that
the marriage was void in law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what respect, Mr. Cornelius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andrews had a wife living at the time of his
second marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had the second wife any knowledge of the fact
before her cohabitation with the deceased, or at any
period thereafter, prior to the springing of her claim,
with the simultaneous mortgage which the law
gives to married women and minors as their best
security?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much does the second wife claim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the value of the succession?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The house may be worth twenty; and the house
is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you succeed, the widow is a beggar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both law and justice are against you, Mr. Cornelius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not here to learn what justice is, justice in
the abstract, Mr. Didimus; I might travel far and
not find it. Positive justice, the positive rules of
the legislator, the justice of the law is that with
which we have to do. There is no natural right to
property. Property is a creature of the law. With
one, it is just that the eldest born should take all;
and with another, it is just that the succession should
be equally divided between sons and daughters.
Here, the youngest claims the largest portion; and
there, the female is preferred to the male. Positive
rules, the wisdom of many wise men, of many generations,
do, with every people, both make and unmake
the right and the wrong. The law is justice,
and I ask what the law awards me. If the law gives
to the wife a tacit mortgage to secure her paraphernal
rights, the law also gives to me a judgment
mortgage to recover my rights of contract. She
must show a valid marriage; I must show registration.
We stand upon the same platform; and if I
prevail, it is because the law is with me. No injustice
is done, Mr. Didimus. The widow cannot have
what is not here; thank God, no injustice is done.”
And the rich man, as he closed his defense, stretched
out his hands clutchingly toward me, as if to take
possession of the large sum of money which seemed
passing beyond his grasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing all that you have advanced to be true,
Mr. Cornelius; yet, as the widow in the case under
consideration, married and cohabited with her late
husband in entire ignorance of the fraud which had
been practiced upon her, the law, both in letter and
spirit protects her; and I must respectfully decline
any further action in the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cornelius bid me good morning.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Some few weeks subsequent to the interview just
related, a lady habited in deep mourning called upon
me, and put a large bundle of papers into my hands.
It was the widow; and the papers were a statement
of her husband’s succession, much of his correspondence,
evidences of her claim, and the usual copies,
which had been served upon her, of a process which
Mr. Cornelius had instituted under the advice of
counsel more pliant, or wiser than myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know something of this already,” said I, after
having hastily glanced over the contents of the package.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, then I am unfortunate, for you are retained
upon the other side,” said the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might have been so, but declined; and, believing
as I do that you are in the right, you will permit
me to hope that you are not unfortunate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The past is dark enough,” said she, “the future
is with God alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Andrews had a wife living at the time of
your marriage with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The evidence of that fact is in your possession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You received from your mother’s succession
fifty thousand dollars, which your late husband
squandered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was imprudent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of your husband’s first marriage you were ignorant,
until after his decease?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That knowledge came to me a double sorrow,
quick following his death; to me more terrible than
death. Now, alone in the world, with none of my
blood known to me, I come to you as my defender.
The law is a stern master; sometimes blind. If I
lose, I lose all, a beggar, with a name suspected, I
can do little else than lie down and die!” and she
covered her face with her hands, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cornelius is honest,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cornelius knows not my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would take nothing from his wealth. True, he
is a man of large property, but my folly has, in part,
brought this sorrow upon me; let the law judge between
us, I will be content.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, madam, you show the right spirit, and my
best endeavors shall be exerted in your behalf,” said
I, as the lady rose, and gave me her hand at parting.
“Wait, trust in your counsel; and if you lose, still
wait, still hope; <span class='it'>for every thing is rewarded and
avenged in time</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My fair client’s heart was too full to speak of gratitude;
and I handed her to the door, and took leave
of her in silence.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I returned to the papers and studied them, far into
the night. There was the evidence of the fifty thousand
dollars received; and there, too, was the evidence
of the prior marriage—the first wife living at
the time of the taking of the second. It was a sad
tale, the story of that first wife; a tale of neglect, of
desertion, of want and wo; a tale told in letters
written from a far distant land, and blotted with
many tears. I steeled my heart against it. How
else could we of “The Profession” live? As the
surgeon, compassionless, cuts with steady nerve
through flesh, and bone, and marrow, and saves the
life which pity would have lost; so we soon learn
to close the heart to sorrow; to hear nothing, to see
nothing but the interest of the client; to hope for
nothing but his success—God protect us! Ever
dealing with the passions and the vices of men;
their unholy race after mammon; strifes by the way-side;
plots and counter-plots; faith broken; trusts
betrayed; snares for the unwary; the innocent
duped; the unfortunate trampled upon; the hoary
sinner honored—God protect us! Great wonder is
it, that we do not loathe the very name of man!
Poor woman! If she who assumed your name and
state, and defiled the marriage bed, which with you
alone was pure, was guilty, although ignorant, of a
careless haste, the punishment has come, equal to
the fault; and you, too, are avenged—even in time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I often saw my client, during the period of one
year, which elapsed between my retainer and the
trial of the suit which she had engaged me to defend.
She was young—she could not have been more than
twenty—without children, and her beauty grew
upon me every day. With a fine figure—not too
light, but rather a little heavy, with the <span class='it'>embonpoint</span>
of the widow—with features, which were the handsomer
for being irregular, and eyes which spoke the
sex with all its glory and its weakness. She interested
something more than professional pride, or
manly compassion in her favor. Her intellect, too,
was brilliant and cultivated; and her manners most
refined: certainly it would have been pardonable in
a bachelor to have made her cause wholly his own.
But there was a mystery woven into the history of her
life, which she either could not, or was not pleased to
remove. In one only, of the many papers and few family
letters which she from time to time put into my
hands, did I find any allusion made to her father. She
never herself voluntarily spoke of him; and whenever
I questioned her upon the subject, she was evidently
much troubled by my inquiries, and professed to be
utterly ignorant of that side of her house. She had
known her mother only under her maiden name, and
had lived with her, in one of our northern cities in
great seclusion, until she met with Mr. Andrews,
married him, and removed to New Orleans. Shortly
after her marriage her mother had died, bequeathing
her fifty thousand dollars, the result of economy and
business habits. What folly, what shame, what
crime had given her birth, or had removed as beneath
a cloud her father from her sight, she knew
not; but her mother had often told her that she was
born in honest wedlock, and that some day she should
claim her own. She knew not the place of her birth,
nor her mother’s relatives, and stood as one without
relationship in the world. How her heart yearned
to find in other veins the blood which flowed in her
own! At such times, when my questions had stirred
the fountain of her tears, and the grief of desolation
ran over, she would wring her hands in a passion of
sorrow, and call upon heaven to give her knowledge—to
give her father to her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon,” she would murmur, “these exhibitions
of my weakness; it is terrible not to know the father
that begat you; terrible to hear want, even to destitution,
knocking at your door.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The day fixed for the trial came. I felt prepared,
strong at all points save one, that of my client’s parentage.
There was a suspicion about it which
would not tell well with the jury. As to the law
which governed the case, provided no knowledge of
the first marriage were brought home to my client
prior to the springing of her mortgage, I was sure of
it; and I believe that no one of my brethren at the
“Bar” would now dispute the correctness of my
opinion. But the fact of knowledge, a jury might
infer from very slight evidence, and my client’s
seeming bastardy and strange ignorance of her father,
and of her mother even, beyond the certainty that
she once lived and cared well for her young days,
were better fitted to excite suspicion and clothe
her in the garb of an adventurer, than to secure pity
or be urged as arguments of innocence. This was
the assailable point. I had thought much upon it,
and had concluded that it was to be best defended by
an open avowal, and a bold appeal to the more generous
sympathies of our nature. Thus armed, I entered
the court-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The court was upon the bench, and the opposite
party, with his counsel, was there, ready, expecting
the battle, and confident of a success which was to
take from the widow all that she possessed. Mr.
Cornelius was there. Tall and meagre in his person,
with cheeks hollowed and hair whitened, by
age and long continued labor and great self-denial,
ending in extreme penuriousness, his eyes alone
retained a show of the vigor of youth. Gray, cold
and piercing, they rolled quickly and incessantly
from side to side, as if every where and at all times
in search of the yellow metal upon which his soul
fed, and grew smaller and smaller, even to a pin’s
point. His brow was thickly furrowed with the
lines of gain; but it was a noble one, and showed a
strong intellect bound in chains of its own forging—enslaved
to Mammon. Yes, John Cornelius cannot
say, on that last day when rich and poor shall stand,
equal at the feet and shoulders, before their common
God, that he labored according to his light. Success
in life, success in any department of the business
of life, a success extended over a quarter of a
century of years, presupposes intellect, and a great
deal of it. A fortune may be won by the turn of a
card, and a fortune may be lost as well; but that fortune
which is gathered slowly and surely, the result
of foresight, of a deep knowledge of the ways of
commerce, its growth, fluctuations and changes, of its
adaptation to the wants of men and the humors of
the times; the result of a providence which sees the
coming storm and provides for it, which sees the
prosperous breeze and catches it—such a fortune is
the result of a strong intellect, equally with any
greatness whatever. John Cornelius cannot say that
he labored according to his light!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There he sat, and as he clutched, with his long,
thin, bony fingers, at the papers which lay spread
out upon the table before him, as if they were the
stout line which was to draw unto him the gold he
coveted, I thought of the story of the Rich Man and
the Lamb, told in the olden writ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My client was also beside me. Still habited in
black—she might well mourn the wrong she had suffered,
if not the man she had loved—the veil lifted
from her face, a little pale with hope and sorrow,
and a womanly modesty possessing in quick turn all
her features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She won the favor of the court; and the jury, as
each was sworn and took his seat within the box,
whispered compassion.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION VI.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>My adversaries saw, clearly enough, the ground
upon which I stood, and the able junior counsel, in
opening the case, with great art alluded to it, and
fully shadowed forth the position in the defense
which was to be most strenuously attacked. “The
plaintiff’s mortgage was undoubted; I had myself
acknowledged it in the answer on file in the record;
neither was the amount alleged by the defendant to
have been received by her late husband from the succession
of her mother to be disputed, the evidence
was conclusive; but the marriage was illegal; that
would hardly be questioned. Was the defendant in
good faith at the time of its celebration? Was she
in good faith when her late husband took possession
of her mother’s succession? Was she in such good
faith as would secure to her the rights of a legal
marriage? These were the questions to be answered,
and he believed that the evidence which he
was about to bring home to the knowledge of the
jury, would answer them most emphatically in the
negative. He then spoke of Andrews’ long residence
in New Orleans; of his many acquaintances
there; of his well-known marriage with the daughter
of a French Jew; of his desertion of his wife; of her
return, with her aged father, to France; of the second
marriage, hastily made up; of the plaintiff’s sudden
appearance in that city, claiming a position due alone
to honesty, while Andrews spoke of her to his associates
as his concubine; of the hints which she had
received of the imposition she was striving to practice
upon others, or which had been in reality practiced
upon herself; and of the deaf ear which she
ever turned to such warnings; of her feigned incredulity;
and of the mystery which hung over and
covered, with impenetrable darkness, the history of
her birth. He closed with an appeal to the judgment
of the jury—cautioned them against the blinding influence
of the passions—spoke of the dangerous eloquence
of a woman in weeds—besought them to
keep their reason unclouded, and not suffer sympathy
to work a wrong—and asked for justice, sheer justice,
the justice of the law, that right might be vindicated
without respect of persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence went far to sustain the labored and
wily exposition of the advocate. The first marriage;
the desertion; Andrews’ long residence in
New Orleans; his numerous acquaintances, putting
inquiry within the easy reach of every one; his visit
to the North; his early return accompanied by the
defendant, who claimed the privileges and honors of
a wife; his disclaimer of her right to such privileges
and honors, repeatedly made to his associates;
the many hints which the defendant had received
from the well disposed and compassionate, as to her
true position, early in her marriage; her confused
replies, and faint and soon relinquished inquiries;
her unwillingness to speak of her family, and studied
silence whenever the subject was alluded to; the
suspicion which rested upon her mother’s name, and
the existence of the first wife, living even at that
time, in retirement and sorrow in one of the small
towns in the north of France, all was proved by testimony
which seemed fair enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Cornelius’ eyes glared gloatingly upon the
gold already present to their sight, and he turned his
hands one within the other, in the joy of the certainty
of success.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION VII.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I opened the defense. I saw a new countenance
upon the twelve faces before me. There was now
no pity, but distrust and a hardening of the heart,
and opinion more than half made up. I walked
warily, began afar off; called them honest—and so
indeed they were—acknowledged the first marriage,
acknowledged the first wife living, in sorrow and in
want; acknowledged the plaintiff’s mortgage; claimed
nothing from sympathy for the poor, nothing from
sympathy for the wronged widow, nothing from
sympathy for the orphan; alluded to the thick shadows
in which time and circumstances, and a probable
wrong, had enveloped the mother’s early life,
and with which they had nothing to do; spoke of
that mother’s purity of conduct during a period of
many years, of her industry, of her accumulation of
wealth, of her care for an only child, her daughter
and my client; of the daughter’s peculiar position in
society; of her young ignorance of the world; of her
wide separation from Andrews’ place of residence;
of her indiscreet confidence when wooed, pardonable
in one whose own life was to her a mystery; of the
hints which she had received subsequent to her marriage,
and of the suspicions which had been aroused,
suspicions well answered and well put to rest by
suggestions of the malice of her husband’s enemies,
and by trust in the man she loved, in the man into
whose arms she had surrendered all—a trust most
honorable in a woman. But where was the first
wife? Why had she remained silent? Wronged,
deserted, driven out, she must have been ready to
give credence to any report in disparagement of her
husband. Under such circumstances, hints and inuendoes
in which the defendant could put no faith,
could not satisfy her that she had been deceived.
This was the position which we occupied; this was
our defense. The evidence which I was about to introduce
said all that I said, and into its keeping I
willingly surrendered the property and the good
name of the widow and orphan, whose cause is holy
in the sight of God and of men. <span class='it'>Cum deceptis jura
subveniunt.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now for me to introduce the evidence on
the part of the defense, and I did so in the order
which reason at once suggests as the most natural
and direct. First, of the marriage, which was not
denied; then of the wife’s inheritance, which Andrews
had received, and of which the proof was too
full to be questioned; and then, as part of the <span class='it'>res
gestæ</span>, letters written by Andrews at different periods,
and in times of temporary absence, breathing
confidence and love, and twice alluding to the suspicions
which the idle gossip of his enemies had
planted in the breast of his wife, and branding them
as the offspring of an unfounded malice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I passed the papers to the clerk, I turned and
looked upon Mr. Cornelius. His hands rested,
clenched, upon his knees, but his eyes still reached
for the gold which was fast receding in the distance.
My client had, from the first, put off all womanly
fear, and listened to the argument and watched the
testimony with a clear brow, pale from resolution.
Once, when the junior counsel in his opening speech,
hinted at concubinage—a crime too frequent, too
much bred into the customs of the city not to gain
an easy credence—the blood mounted, suffused her
temples, bathed her whole face in the ruddy light of
a golden sunset, and then flowed back not to return
again. Now, she was cool enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next read letters from the mother, dated both
before and after the daughter’s marriage. They
were written with great elegance and simplicity, and
all started from the same point, and all came back to
it again—a mother’s care and unceasing anxiety for
her daughter’s physical health, for her mental improvement,
for her moral purity. The court was
touched; a manly sorrow sat, veiled, upon the hard
features of the jury; the miser shook, like an aspen-leaf,
through every limb. I paused—and then took
up another, the last, written but a few days prior to
the mother’s death, the last words of that mother to
her child, in life. Its manner, the solemn cadence
of the periods, the matter, fell slowly and heavily
upon the ear, like the thick breathings of one with
whom the world has little more to do. The shadow
rested upon the hand as it wrote. It was crowded
with the griefs of many years. It spoke darkly of
wrongs received; of a stern resolve; of labors endured,
and endured joyously for the offspring of a
love struck-down, and changed to very hate, even in
the first hour of its young life; of one whose name
her daughter’s lips had never syllabled; of one living,
prosperous in the world, the daughter’s father and
her husband. Wait, yet a little while, and she
should know the blood which had begotten her, and
claim her own—a rich inheritance equal with the
noblest in the land. Alas! that waiting was to be
too long! Death had sealed the mother’s lips, and
there sat the daughter, hunted, hunted like a hare
by the hounds of the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My client covered her face with the folds of her
robe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How does the mother sign herself?” asked the
judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ann Chapman, may it please your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ann Chapman!” exclaimed John Cornelius
springing to his feet. “Ann Chapman! Give me
the letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I put it into his hands. His eyes glanced at the
date, and then rested, fixed, upon the signature. The
pallor of the dead crept slowly over him; his arms
gave up their strength and fell to his side, the paper
dropped upon the floor. “Here, take it, take it,”
he said, in a hollow whisper, looking straight out
upon vacuity; “it is nothing, nothing, nothing.”
Then turning to his counsel, he bid them enter a
discontinue, and walked hurriedly out of court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a strange ending!” said the judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My client is mad!” said the opposite senior
counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our client is mad!” echoed his junior, bundling
up his papers with a piece of red tape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mad or sane, gentlemen, it is a fit conclusion to
what should never have been begun,” said I, taking
the young widow under my arm and leading her
away, much wondering at the abrupt termination of
the suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think Mr. Cornelius has really gone
mad?” she asked, looking up into my face with a
tear upon her eyelids. It was one of sorrow, not
joy; God bless her, she had forgotten her good fortune
in sympathy for her oppressor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If to have a conscience is to be so,” I answered;
and took leave of her at the door of her residence—at
the door of the house we had battled for—so
happy, that she tried and could not say, “I
thank you.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION VIII.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I returned to my office in a very good humor with
all the world. Upon my table I found a note from
Mr. Cornelius, requesting me to call upon him at an
early hour in the evening. “A compromise—no
compromises, Mr. Cornelius. If you will, begin
again; but the widow shall keep all, to the last farthing.”
And I dispatched a reply, saying I would
be with him precisely at eight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Cornelius lived in the upper part of the city,
in a very large and costly house, which had been
built by a parvenu of sudden wealth. It covered,
with the surrounding grounds, two-thirds of a
square, and had been purchased by Mr. Cornelius at
the sale of the parvenu’s succession, rather on account
of the land, than for any profitable use which
he could make of the noble structure to which the
land was appurtenant. The increasing commerce
of the city had so surrounded it with warehouses
and presses for cotton, as to render it impossible to
find a tenant at even a three per cent. rent, so he
moved into it himself, and, with one slave, lived
there upon fifty cents a day. The spacious and unfurnished
halls, dark, gloomy, venerable with dust,
returned a hollow echo to my tread, as I entered at
the appointed hour. I found the miser sitting at a
small table, covered with papers, in the centre of a
large room; the table and two chairs, that which he
occupied and one reserved for myself, were all of
furniture that it contained. He looked very pale,
did not rise to receive me, but in silence waived his
hand as an invitation to be seated. I obeyed, and
waited for a declaration of the motives which had
induced him to request my presence. But during
the lapse of ten minutes he did not speak, so I drew
his note from my pocket and pushing it toward him
across the table, observed that my time was worth
one dollar the minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your client is my daughter,” said Mr. Cornelius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your daughter! Then you are mad, sure
enough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cornelius gathered up the papers which lay
upon the table before him and put them into my
hands. They were, first, a certificate of his marriage
with Ann Chapman, in the city of New York,
on the ninth day of October, eighteen hundred and —;
second, articles of separation entered into, and signed
in duplicate, by both parties, just one year thereafter—being
done at New York on the ninth day of October,
one thousand eight hundred and —; and last,
several letters received by Mr. Cornelius from his
wife’s relatives at wide intervals, and at periods long
subsequent to their stipulated divorce. The articles
contained an acknowledgment on the part of Mrs.
Cornelius of her having received twenty thousand
dollars from her husband in full satisfaction of all
claims upon him for support, and of her right of
dower in his estate; the letters were written in
answer to inquiries made by himself as to his wife’s
existence and condition in life, and all, without exception,
expressed an utter inability to give him any
information upon the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In eighteen hundred and —,” said Mr. Cornelius,
“I visited the North, and there met with and hastily
married Ann Chapman, then a young woman of
humble parentage—not otherwise than my own—with
much beauty, a moderate education, and a
spirit which was equal to any fortune. My business
called me to England, and upon my return I saw, or
fancied that I saw, some change in her feelings toward
me. She was honest, as honest as the light in
which God robes himself; but the great disparity of
our ages made me jealous of her affection; and as
she was of a strong temper, not easily controlled,
while I was in some degree unreasonable and exacting,
we soon quarreled, made each other miserable,
and, by mutual consent, separated. When I took
leave of her, she put her hand in mine, and with a
calmness which was terrible, called down every
suffering upon her head if, with her assent, I should
see her face again. She would go and hide her sorrow
among strangers, and even the fruit of our short-lived
love, which she then carried in her bosom,
should not know me until grief and many years had
ripened me for the grave. I returned to New Orleans;
I returned to my labor and my money getting—and
she, alas! she kept her purpose too well!
Through many a long month, and through many a
long year, have I repented of that folly, to find only
at this hour the blood which is my own. I have
heaped up gold and houses and lands—sir, my wife
and daughter would have made me a better man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he drew down his long silver locks over his
face and covered it with his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you satisfied as to the identity; have you no
doubts, Mr. Cornelius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a richly chased miniature from his bosom
and bid me look at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the mother as she was at twenty; it is the
daughter of to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I started with surprise; it could not have been more
like, had the young widow sat for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The evidence is conclusive, Mr. Cornelius; and
I will now take a fee upon the other side. Let us
go at once to her house, and claim not only that, but
its fair occupant also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, we must meet here. These walls know
me; I am at home; and I must receive my daughter
in my own house,” said Mr. Cornelius. “You are
her best friend—hereafter you shall be mine; do you
then call upon her, break this matter gently to her,
and in the morning you will find me here, waiting
your coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not tell her that I have found her father,”
said I, “for that would be subjecting her nerves to
two trials; and it might be that you would be compelled
to go to her in the end, with a physician at
your back. It is better that she should be made to
expect one good fortune, and find another; so, I will
tell her that you relented, discontinued your suit from
sheer pity, and wish to make her a present equal in
value to the amount which was involved in the dispute
between you, as a small compensation for the
trouble you have given her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you please,” said Mr. Cornelius, smiling, no
doubt at the improbability of the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never fear, a woman’s faith is large enough to
believe any thing,” said I, not wishing to be misunderstood;
and the miser now rose, and accompanied
me to the door.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION IX.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning, the young widow and myself
walked slowly along toward her father’s residence;
I, more than half ashamed of the deception I had put
upon her; and she, wondering at the fortune which
had poured a golden shower into her lap, and framing
thanks to be heaped upon the good man, who had
threatened poverty only to bestow riches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door she hesitated, and said that I must
speak for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said I, “nature will put fit words
into your mouth, and some things are best expressed
by silence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered—the widow hanging upon my arm;
her whole weight was upon it—not very large, indeed—for
she was ready to sink down, oppressed
with a load of gratitude. John Cornelius sat where
I had found him the preceding evening, at the little,
table covered with papers, in the centre of the room,
and with one vacant chair. Well, thought I, we
shall not want a third. He rose with much coldness
in his manner, bowed formally, took his daughter’s
hand, and assisted her to the vacant seat; he then
gave me that which he had himself occupied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam,” said he, after a short pause, and in a
voice which seemed stoutly braced with resolution,
and yet just ready to break down, “I have requested
your presence here, in order that you might read
these papers, for they somewhat concern you;” and
taking up the certificate of marriage, and the articles
of separation, he held them out toward her. She received
them, with a word of thanks, thinking no
doubt, that they were titles to the property which I
had induced her to believe was to be bestowed upon
her. As she read the articles, her color left her, and
a cold sweat started from her brow and rolled down
her face, and wet her garments. The certificate she
carried twice to her eyes, and twice failed to read,
but glared upon it like one who sees a vision in his
sleep: the third time she read it aloud, screaming as
if to make certain with her voice, what her eyes
doubted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this,” shouted Cornelius, drawing the picture
from his bosom and holding it up, her other self,
before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God—my father!” she exclaimed, rising
slowly, and pulling at her fingers; then swayed to
and fro, uncertain of her step; leaped into the old
man’s arms, fastened about his neck, and slept insensible,
upon his bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Cornelius sank with his burden upon the
floor, and wept, and sobbed like a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A broad, plain, gold ring rolled bounding to my
feet. I picked it up. Within the circle were engraved
two letters, “J. C.” It was the bridal ring, a gift
from her mother, as Ægeus gave his sword to Æthra,
that the father might recognize his child, when in
the fulfillment of time they should meet.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION X.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Merry days these—happy days these—let us laugh
and grow fat, for to-morrow we die. The miser’s
daughter had a hundred suitors, and well she might;
for she was young, and beautiful, and pure. And
was she not heir-apparent of millions? Good Lord!
Good Lord! how they did amble, and trot, and show
their paces, and protest, and pray, and besiege—all
to no purpose! And those jurymen, too, who were
baulked of their verdict, did they not open their eyes
widely when the story was told them, and say that
they knew it would be so? And the judge, did he
not crack his joke with the junior counsel, and bemoan
the young man’s stars which had so betrayed
his interest, and wagged his tongue with some venom
in it, upon the losing side? And the counsel, senior
and junior—did they not assume a show of wisdom,
and say that from the beginning they had no confidence
in the cause? A blind business was it with us all,
when we undertook to mete out justice to father and
daughter, with a seven-fold cloud before our eyes;
and a blind business the law ever is.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION XI.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The fair widow moved into her father’s house, and
carried joy with her, and smiles, and a new life.
The dusty halls and silent chambers were soon made
glad, and gave no echo back to the busy feet which
beat their floors in measured tread to the sound of
lutes. Men wondered at the miser’s transformation,
and the jolly sun, driving up the clear, blue, vaulted
roof of the earth, looked in upon curtains, and mirrors,
and rich carpets, and all the bought luxury of
great wealth, and danced upon the draped walls, and
laughed, and wondered too. But the change was of
the surface. The miser loved his daughter with his
whole soul; he loved gold with more than his whole
soul—gold, his first love—and the daughter held a divided
and an inferior empire in his affections. The
miser loved his daughter as he best might, with his
heart of shining metal, and he would have loved her
had she been less than what she was; less beautiful,
less worthy, less full of the love which flowed from
her like a sea, and covered him, and he drank of it,
a joy he had never known. He loved her, as the
heir to his vast estates, as himself renewed, to bear
his labor onward, to accumulate through still another
span of life; and he showed her to the world, and
took pride in this new glory, as a new title to his
possessions, which was to carry them with himself,
even beyond the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was often with them; I became almost an inmate
of the house, subsequent to the events which
I have just related—the father’s legal adviser, the
daughter’s best friend. Mr. Cornelius did not weary
of the empty bustle and noise of fashion with which
his daughter’s youth and brilliant position at once
surrounded her; he seemed pleased with it, and
often spoke of it as the proud homage which intellect,
and nice honor, and high titles, and all the
virtues, and all the prejudices of men, pay to
wealth—and so, indeed, it was. With the daughter,
these enjoyments soon palled. She had learned of
sorrow from her birth, and had happily received
from her mother a head too strong for turning; when,
therefore, novelty wore away, and satiety began to
usurp its place, she gradually withdrew from the
press of company, and gave to her father those hours
which others had before possessed. Although change
had come over every thing else, Mr. Cornelius forbid
its entrance into the one room reserved for himself;
the room in which he had received his daughter,
with the little table and the two chairs standing in
the centre, and its naked walls and bare door, which
were to him as old acquaintances, and where, alone,
he now felt fully at home. There they would often
sit together in the deep hours of the night, and
while she played with his white locks, and watched
the beatings of his heart, to find it tuned to a music
widely different from her own, and listened to his
never-ending promises, and never-ending hopes of a
wealth which was to make his only one, his jewel,
a match which princes might envy, she became
painfully conscious of her father’s worldliness and
debasing servitude to the hard earth. She saw that
he lay prone, chained, bound down with clamps of
iron, of silver, and of gold, and never raised his
eyes to the upper light, or questioned of the day
when he should be called to give an account of his
stewardship. Then she would weep, and kiss her
father, and talk of her mother who had passed away,
and of another life, and hope that they might all
meet in that better world; and the miser would
stroke down her glossy hair with his trembling
hands, and press her forehead to his lips, and call her
a foolish girl, who troubled herself about matters
with which she had nothing to do; and bade her go
and dream of the glory to which he had raised her,
and count her suitors, and be brave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More, more,” was the miser’s unceasing cry;
“all, all—I want all,” was the prayer which he put
up, not to the Giver of all Good, but to his own will,
which habit had enslaved, until use made servitude
a happiness. And he worked on, ever gaining, ever
adding, abstemious, pinching, self-denying, liberal
only to his daughter, whom he could never see too
richly clad, too sumptuously served—a costly toy to
be stared at and admired. “She is my diamond,”
he would say, “which I have chosen to plant in
a rich setting.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION XII.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But the daughter grew, day by day, more thoughtful,
denied herself more frequently to her followers,
and was more and more often to be found sitting
with her father, alone, at the little table, winning
him from his labor. Mr. Cornelius was too much
engrossed with the world, with money-getting, to
observe the beginning and progress of the change in
his daughter’s manner, amusements, and way of
life; and he soon learned to work on, with his child
at his side, half unconscious of her presence, and yet
alive to the pleasurable feeling that there was something
near him which he much loved. I was not
so blind. As month after month rolled away, I saw
the shadow of a great melancholy creep slowly over
her face, and deepen, and deepen, until it had imparted
that exquisite softness to her beauty which is
the surest symptom of decay. We see it in the
flower; time gives it to all the works of man; and
genius shows it, as the flame trembles, flickers, leaps
upward, and goes out. The heart was sick; the
spirit grew toward heaven. I had occasion, one
evening, to be with Mr. Cornelius until a late hour,
conversing about some matters in the courts which
he had entrusted to my care; we had talked much,
and the last watch was drawing to a close, when
the door quietly opened, and his daughter entered,
holding in one hand a light stool, and in the other a
book. “The gentleman will excuse us for a moment,”
she said, addressing her father; then turning
to me, she received me with her usual cordiality.
“I have adopted a practice, of late, of reading
a chapter to my father before retiring,” she continued;
“and you can remain, if you please, and
join us in our devotions—surely, such worship can
harm no one.” And sitting down at her father’s
knees, she laid the holy volume in his lap, opened
it, and read; while he bent over her until his silver
locks mingled with the jetty tresses of her hair, and
listened to her teaching—it was time, old, worn-out
time, called to eternity by a sweet messenger from
God. “There, that will do, my child; put up the
book,” said Mr. Cornelius, as his daughter’s voice,
losing its firmness, grew uncertain, and tears fell
pattering upon the story she repeated: “certainly,
certainly, it is not for me, in my old age, to learn of
one so young.” It was a simple tale, a touching
parable, told by Christ; so appropriate as to require
from me no further designation. “Why, what
spirit has come over you of late—always weeping!”
said the old man, kissing the moisture from her
eyelids. “What do you want? All that I have is
yours. Now go—and see that you show a merry
face in the morning.” The daughter rose, and bid
us good-night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not think Anne has lost a little of her
color—grown slightly pale, Mr. Didimus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made known the fears which I had long entertained,
and to which each day added a confirmation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter’s sick! sick at heart! Nonsense!
What has she to be sick about? Are not my coffers
open to her hand? What power of this earth is
greater than her gold? Sick!—And yet, now I do
remember, that for the past month, or more, no
music has come into me, as it was wont, from her
crowded rooms; no sounds of merriment, of joy, of
the frivolity of fools, grating upon the ear of night;
no cringing, no bowing low with doffed hat, and
giving of God’s health, as I pass in and out at my
own door. Look to it: you are my daughter’s
best friend; question her; inquire out the secret
sorrow which preys upon her mind—surely, money
is a medicine for all the ills of life. She requires a
change of place; these stuffed marts about us breed
foul air; let her travel. Or, perhaps, she has again
listened to the idle whispers of love, and conceals
from me her weakness. Tell her, that although I
would have her live with me during the short remainder
of my life, yet she shall marry where she
may choose; to give me a long line of heirs, rich,
rich, through two centuries. Sick! why I was never
sick!” And the miser bent over the little table, and
returned to his calculations.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION XIII.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The miser’s history went on as before—still gaining,
still adding; while the daughter’s bloom passed
slowly away. Her limbs lost their roundness, her
face grew sharp and hollow, and grief sat ever upon
it, until her friends had almost forgotten its former
mirth and beauty, and were half persuaded that it
had been always so. No questioning of mine would
entice her to an explanation. “It is a matter with
which you can have nothing to do. There is no
remedy in your hands. Let me alone; I wrestle
daily with my God.” What could I say? I was
silent; for it was indeed a matter with which I had
nothing to do. Preach to the drunkard over his
cups; to the gambler, when he wins; to the man
whose garments are like unto his who came from
Edom, red with the blood of men, and gain a soul
for Heaven; but the miser, with one foot on Mammon,
the other on the grave, never yet turned
from his first love, or forgot the gods which his own
hands have fashioned. John Cornelius became used
to his daughter’s declining health, and soon ceased
to speak of it. Indeed, engrossed in his labors of
accumulation, he began to think she was well
enough, as well as she ever had been, and that the
change, if change there was, was in his own eyes,
which had, perhaps, grown somewhat dim with
age. Poor Anne! she nightly sat at her father’s
knees, and nightly read to him, and he nightly praised
her beauty, and called her a foolish girl, and kissed
away her tears, and babbled of gold, till her heart
withered within her, and she withdrew to dream
of her mother, and a great joy, and to gather a new
courage to begin again her ceaseless task, ever hoping,
ever disappointed. Thus ran a year away.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION XIV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One bright morning in November, here the sweetest
month of all the twelve, Mr. Cornelius called
at my office, and informed me that his daughter
had been sick, confined to her bed for the past
two days, and had expressed a wish to see me. He
said her indisposition was but slight, attributed it to
some frivolous cause, and expressed a hope that it
would soon pass off. I looked up into his face; he
was honest; still blind to his daughter’s decay;
death stood palpably before him, robed in the freshness
of youth. Death! How should he see death?
Gold was ever in his thoughts; gold filled his vision;
his taste, his scent were gold; and gold ran clinking
into his ears: death had walked his house a year
unrecognized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I laid aside my papers, and accompanied Mr.
Cornelius home. He passed into his own room,
with the little table and the two chairs; I ascended
to his daughter’s chamber. What a mockery was
there of all that this world loves so much, strives
after, and wins, with loss of body and of soul!
Upon a bed, canopied with rich stuffs of woven silk
and gold, with curtains of satin, rose-colored, and
tugged with tassels of silver, spread with the finest
linen, and covered with flowers, worked upon a
ground of velvet, lay Anne, the miser’s daughter,
pale and emaciated, and with her eyes, to whatever
point they might turn, resting upon some new evidence
of her father’s wealth and worldliness, upon
some new evidence of the cause of all her sorrow.
Her physician stood at her bed-side; as I entered
he raised his finger to his lips, and came to me.
“She is passing away,” he whispered. I approached
the bed slowly, and on tiptoe. Anne felt
my presence in the air, and turning her face toward
me, held out her hand. I took it in mine. “I have
called you,” said she, in a voice scarcely audible,
“to take leave of you. You have been my good
friend since the day that we first met in your office;
I a poor woman, striving for that which I have long
since found to be of little worth; when I am gone,
transfer your friendship to my father. Tell him
where I may be found, and bid him there seek for
me. Oh, God! how long have I wrestled with
thee, in bitter prayer, for this favor; thou wilt not,
in the end, deny it to me. Farewell! We shall
meet again! I go to my mother. Now bring my
father to me, and let us be alone together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician pressed her hand in silence, turned
to the wall, and went out. I followed, and we both
hastened to call Mr. Cornelius. We found him
counting over a bag of silver, which he had just received
from a tenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is my daughter? Better—well?” he asked,
still continuing to count, and to test the genuineness
of the metal by ringing it upon the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir—your daughter is dying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dying!” and the coin rolled merrily upon the
floor. “Dying—doctor? Tut, tut. You jest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cornelius, your daughter wishes to speak
with you, to give you her last words in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Charlatan</span>—quack—driveler—you lie!” cried
the miser with livid lips, starting to his feet, and
shaking his clenched hands in the physician’s face.
“Die!—my daughter shall not die—she cannot die—the
children of the rich never die—what would you
have? Gold!—here is a bill for fifty thousand—save
my daughter—ay, I will make it a hundred thousand—but
save my daughter—poor, poor, poor Anne!”
and his head fell, and rested upon his breast. The
old man stood before us motionless, transfixed with
grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cornelius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am sick with much sorrow! Lend me
your arm? Did you not say something of twenty
per cent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I led him away to his daughter’s chamber. As
we entered, her face was turned toward us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who said that my daughter was dead?” asked
Mr. Cornelius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne feebly smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall all spring upward from the ground,
winged; and with a power which will bear us
swiftly to the throne, which endureth forever and
forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hastened to bear her father to her bed-side. The
last breath had parted from her lips, and as he questioned
her, and she returned no answer; as he called
to her, and she called not back again, he fell upon
her, and his moan filled the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone! oh my daughter; my jewel of great price—the
heir to all my riches—my second life! Is the
breath of man unbought! Can no one bribe death?
Is there joy in the cold grave? O, come to me, my
child, and sleep in my bosom, and fare sumptuously
every day.” And he drew much gold from his
pockets, and heaped it upon the bed beside her, and
wondered that she should die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the world wondered, also, that she should die.
And idle curiosity poured in to look upon her dust;
and was shocked, and shrugged its shoulders, and
exclaimed—“what a pity! In the morning of life—and
so rich!” And again the world forgot her year
of mourning, and her gradual decay, and carried its
thoughts back to the hours when that small, pinched
face was radiant with health, and a new-found happiness;
and laughter rang from those thin lips, and
merriment sparkled in the closed eye, and whispered
and coined suggestions, and said that “after all she
was not the miser’s daughter, and had died suddenly
with the coming of that certainty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fools and Idiots! Is not the grave open to all?
And did she not well to love her father’s soul better
than his wealth? And did she not well to labor for it,
unceasingly; and then, the crowning of that labor, to
lie down and die?</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SECTION XV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The daughter of the rich man was carried to her
grave upon the shoulders of the rich, followed by a
crowd of worshipers; and as the body was borne
into the Chapel of the Departed, and the procession
flowed in, and filled the aisles, the choristers chanted
the <span class='it'>Requiem</span> for the dead.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Why didst thou leave me thus? Had memory</p>
<p class='dramaline'>No chain to bind thee to me, lone and wrecked</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In spirit as I am? Was there no spell</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of power in my deep, yearning love to stir</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The sleeping fountain of thy soul, and keep</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My image trembling there? Is there no charm</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In strong and high devotion such as mine</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To win thee to my side once more? Must I</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Be cast forever off for brighter forms</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And gayer smiles? Alas! I love thee still.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Love will not, cannot perish in my heart—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>’Twill linger there forever. Even now</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In our own dear, sweet sunset time, the hour</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of passion’s unforgotten tryst, I hush</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The raging tumult of my soul, and still</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The fierce strife in my lonely breast where pride</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Is fiercely struggling for control. Each hue</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of purple, gold and crimson that flits o’er</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The western sky recalls some by-gone joy,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That we have shared together, and my soul</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Is love’s and memory’s.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>In loneliness, the thought comes o’er my heart</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How side by side in moonlight eves, while soft</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The rose-winged hours were flitting by, we stood</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beside that clear and gently-murmuring fount</p>
<p class='dramaline'>O’erhung with wild and blooming vines, and felt</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The spirit of a holy love bedew</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Our hearts’ own budding blossoms. There I drank</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The wild, o’ermastering tide of eloquence</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That flowed from thy o’erwrought and burning soul.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>There thou didst twine a wreath of sweetest flowers</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To shine amid my dark brown locks, and now</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beside me lies a bud, the little bud</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thou gav’st me in the glad, bright summer-time,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Telling me ’twas the emblem of a hope</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That soon would burst to glorious life within</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Our spirit’s garden. The poor fragile bud</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Is now all pale and withered, and the hope</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Is faded in my lonely breast, and cast</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Forever forth from thine.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They tell me, too,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My brow and cheek are very pale—Alas!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>There is no more a spirit-fire within</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To light it with the olden glow. Life’s dreams</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And visions all have died within my soul,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And I am sad and lone and desolate;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And yet at times, when I behold thee near,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A something like the dear old feeling stirs</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Within my breast, and wakens from the tomb</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of withered memories one pale, pale rose,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To bloom a moment there, and cast around</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Its sweet and gentle fragrance, but anon</p>
<p class='dramaline'>It vanishes away, as if it were</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A mockery, the spectre of a flower;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I quell my struggling sighs and wear a smile;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But, ah! that smile, more eloquent than sighs</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Tells of a broken heart.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;’Tis said that thou</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dost ever shine the gayest ’mid the gay,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That loudest rings thy laugh in festive halls,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That in the dance, with lips all wreathed in smiles,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thou whisperest love’s delicious flatteries;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And if my name is spoken, a light sneer</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Is all thy comment. Yet, proud man, I know</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beneath thy hollow mask of recklessness</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thy conscious heart still beats as true to me</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As in the happy eves long past. Ah! once,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In night’s still hour, when I went forth to weep</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beneath our favorite tree, whose giant arms</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Seemed stretched out to protect the lonely girl,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I marked a figure stealing thence away,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And my poor heart beat quick; for oh! I saw,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Despite the closely-muffled cloak, ’twas thou</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Then, then I knew that thou in secrecy</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Had’st sought that spot, like me, to muse and weep</p>
<p class='dramaline'>O’er blighted memories. Thou art, like me,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In heart a mourner. In thy solitude,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When mortal eyes behold thee not, wild sighs</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Convulse thy bosom, and thy hot tears fall</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Like burning rain. Oh! ’twas thy hand that dealt</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The blow to both our hearts. I well could bear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My own fierce sufferings, but thus to feel</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That thou, in all thy manhood’s glorious strength</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dost bear a deep and voiceless agony,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lies on my spirit with the dull, cold weight</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of death. I see thee in my tortured dreams,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And even with a smile upon thy lip,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But a keen arrow quivering deep within</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thy throbbing, bleeding heart. Go, thou may’st wed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Another; but beside the altar dark</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My mournful form will stand, and when thou see’st</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The wreath of orange blossoms on her brow,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Oh! it will seem a fiery scorpion coiled</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Wildly around thine own.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I’m dying now;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Life’s sands are failing fast, the silver cord</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Is loosed and broken, and the golden bowl</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Is shattered at the fount. My sun has set,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And dismal clouds hang o’er me; but afar</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I see the glorious realm of Paradise,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And by its cooling fountains, and beneath</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Its holy shades of palm, my soul will wash</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Away its earthly stains, and learn to dream</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of heavenly joys. Farewell! despite thy cold</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Desertion, I will leave my angel home,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Each gentle eve, at our own hour of tryst,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To hold my vigils o’er thy pilgrimage,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And with my spirit’s-pinion I will fan</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thy aching brow, and by a holy spell,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That I may learn in Heaven, will charm away</p>
<p class='dramaline'>All evil thoughts and passions from thy breast,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And calm the raging tumult of thy soul.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>(<span class='it'>Concluded from page 195.</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mr. Fayerweather</span> and Madam were seated at
breakfast before a blazing fire, one very cold morning
in January. John had already finished, and had
gone to Mr. Wendell’s office, in which he was studying
his profession. Vi’let following Scipio, who had
entered with some warm toast, came up to the table
and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a terrible cold morning, Misser Fayerweather—I
’spect Primus han’t got no wood—he’d
only jist three sticks yesterday; he’s sick with the
rheumatis, too—mayn’t Scip carry him over some?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This meant not wholly for the benefit of Primus,
but also as a wholesome discipline of Scip himself,
whose health Vi’let thought in danger for want of
exercise. Scip glouted at her but did not dare
speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, carry him over a good load Scipio, the
moment you have swallowed your breakfast. Such
a morning as this without wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam added—“And you shall carry him some
stores to make him comfortable. That makes me
think of poor Cluff—I am afraid he is out of every
thing by this time—he must have suffered last night.
I ought to have seen to him before—poor creature!
how could I have neglected him so? I might have
known it was coming on cold, from its being so
warm yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fayerweather endeavored to persuade her
that Cluff could scarcely have consumed the provisions
she sent him on Christmas, but she continued
to reproach herself until he told her that he was obliged
to go out in the sleigh as soon as breakfast was
over, and that he would go down himself and see
that the old man was comfortable and was well taken
care of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The worthy gentleman finished his meal and the
sleigh was ordered out, but the hard cough of the
old horse as the cutting air struck him on being led
out of his warm stable, reached his kind master’s
ear and found its way to his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old Moses!” he said, “it would be hard to
take you out such a day as this, it might be your
death—I’ll walk. I shall be all the better for it.”
So saying, he lost no time in hurrying on his roquelaure,
and set out on a brisk pace, to avoid the expostulations
of his wife, who had gone to look out
some flannels to send Primus. As he passed by Mr.
Wendell’s, his niece having seen him from the window,
was at the door to accost him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, uncle! where are you going this bitter
morning? Do come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t stop me now, child, I’m in haste; perhaps
I’ll drop in as I come back,” he said; then as
he shook his finger at little Will, who was hanging
on his mother’s apron, he gave them both a look so
brimful of kindness and affection and something beyond
both, as went to her very heart. That look
Amy never forgot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cold was intense, but Mr. Fayerweather proceeded
on his way. The air felt like solid ice to his
face, where it was not entirely muffled with the
roquelaure, the cape of which was soon thickly
frosted with his breath. Some shivering, blue-nosed
school-boys made their manners as they passed.
“Run quick, my boys,” he said, “or old Jack Frost
will have fast hold of you. See that you keep a
warm school-room to-day.” A pipkin of water was
thrown after them from a shop door—it was that of
Nanny Boynton’s new residence—it froze as it fell,
and rattled like pebbles on the snowy crust. When
he reached the market-place (it was not a market-day,)
one solitary load of wood was on the stand.
As Mr. Fayerweather came up, the patient beasts
which drew it, turned up their broad faces and
looked wistfully at him beneath the wreaths of snow
formed by their breath as it issued from their nostrils.
The owner was thrashing himself very energetically
with his arms, to induce a sensation of
warmth. Mr. Fayerweather bought the wood and
told the man to carry it up to his house and tell
madam he sent him, this being tantamount with telling
him to go and make himself comfortable by a
good fire, with a good luncheon for himself and his
cattle. Mr. Fayerweather then proceeded on his
way. Dr. Holly’s thermometer stood at 18 below 0.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The table was laid for dinner when he returned
home. His wife met him with as severe reproaches
as she knew how to frame, for walking out on such
a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t scold, my dear,” he replied, good-humoredly,
“you are growing a perfect shrew, I declare.
If you take to scolding, I shall certainly take to
drinking. I am going to take some brandy now.”
Then he went to the buffet, and taking from a liquor
chest which stood in the lower part of it, a case-bottle
of brandy, that had reposed there undisturbed,
time out of mind, and unstopping it, he continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found Cluff very comfortable, in no want of
any thing. I went to two or three other places, but
hadn’t time to call and see Judith as I intended—but
let us have dinner, for my walk has made me
so hungry I could eat a trooper, horse and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam went into the kitchen herself to hasten in
dinner. She remained a moment, to see Vi’let dish
up the turkey, and was, with her own hands, adding
more spice to the gravy, when the sound of some
heavy body falling, hurried her back to the parlor,
followed by all four servants. She found her husband
extended on the floor. She flew to assist him,
supposing he had been tripped up accidentally by the
carpet, but he was without sense or motion. “Quick,
run for the doctor, Scip, he’s faint;” and madam
took the sal volatile from her pocket to apply to his
nostrils. Vi’let looked at him and felt his pulse,
then clasping her hands, exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God Almighty, mistress!” She suddenly checked
herself, and told Flora and Peter to run for Mrs.
Wendell and Madam Brinley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Holly on his arrival found madam in strong
convulsions, requiring both her sister and niece to
hold her, while Mr. Wendell and John, assisted by
Vi’let, were endeavoring to revive Mr. Fayerweather,
who was still on the floor. On examining
him attentively, the Doctor shook his head hopelessly,
but made an immediate attempt to take blood
from the arm. It was in vain—Mr. Fayerweather
was dead. His death, Dr. Holly gave it as his
opinion, was accelerated by exposure to the cold and
the long walk, the disease being a hardening of vessels
about the heart; adding that if he could have
taken the brandy (which stood on the table in a
tumbler, apparently untasted,) it might have saved
him. The grief of the family and friends of the excellent
man may be imagined, but cannot be dwelt
upon here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The funeral was the longest that ever had been
known in Salem, for never was any inhabitant of it
more beloved and respected. As soon as madam
was sufficiently composed, after the funeral, the
ebony cabinet was searched and a will was found,
dated the day before George’s departure. It gave
the widow the homestead, which had become very
valuable, together with the whole of the property
she had brought; after several bequests, a large one
to Mr. and Mrs. Wendell jointly, the remainder of
the property was divided between the two sons.
Mr. Wendell was named as executor. The estate
was perfectly clear and unincumbered and little time
was requisite to settle it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few weeks subsequent to the funeral of Mr.
Fayerweather, the inhabitants of Salem were called
together by an alarm of fire; an occurrence so very
unusual as well as alarming, that it caused a great stir
and commotion in the quiet and orderly town. The
fire broke out in the office of the Register of Deeds,
but was soon put out, doing, as was at first supposed,
but little damage. Upon examination, however, it
was discovered that several books of valuable records
were destroyed, and others much injured. Mr.
Wendell having ascertained that the one containing
the copy of the Boynton quit-claim of the Fayerweather
property was among the burnt, as well as
that of a date many years prior, thought best to lose
no time in having these important documents newly
registered. Accordingly he looked into the cabinet,
which had been put into his possession, for the originals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon a thorough search with John Fayerweather,
no trace of these papers was to be found in the cabinet;
nor, to the astonishment and consternation of
both, in any desk, trunk, drawer or closet in the
premises of the deceased. The only conjecture
madam or John could form in regard to the disappearance
of these papers was, that either through
accident or mistake, they had been left in their original
place of deposit, and were now in the elder
son’s possession in the little trunk. In the first vessel
which sailed for London, therefore, intelligence
was dispatched to Mr. Haliburton of the melancholy
death of his old friend, and of the missing papers,
that he might find means to convey notice to George,
sooner than could be done from Salem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The destruction of the records came to the knowledge
of Jemmy Boynton as soon as to that of Mr.
Wendell, and the delay of the latter to have the
deeds recorded anew, did not escape her notice.
Jemmy was ever on the alert to seize upon every
circumstance which might possibly involve the risk
or loss of property to others, in the well-grounded
hope, which he rarely failed to realize, of in some
way or other turning it to his own benefit. Accordingly
the old fox was not slow to suspect some substantial
reason for such delay or apparent neglect on
the part of so careful a man of business as Mr.
Wendell was well-known to be, and he did not stop
till he had found out the true cause. To arrive at
certainty, he thought it would be best to make a visit
of condolence to the widow, judging from her well-known
simplicity, she would give him all the information
he desired. And he was not mistaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took care to make his visit at a time when he
felt pretty sure Madam Fayerweather would be
alone. It was on a fine morning in June that Jemmy
sallied forth. He had dressed himself in the best his
wardrobe afforded; a suit of fine claret-colored
broadcloth, which had been left in pawn to him
years before by a needy French prisoner on his parole,
and which had never been redeemed; a white
satin waistcoat, grown somewhat yellow with age,
and white silk hose with gold clocks, fitting tight to
his spindle legs; all belonging to the same pledge.
Possibly the finery of the jaunty Frenchman might
have inspired him with some undefined notions of
gallantry; for Jemmy was going to make a call upon
a rich widow just six months in weeds. But if any
airy visions fluttered about his heart and occasioned
the smirk upon his withered physiognomy as he bent
his way to her house, they were speedily put to flight
on entering the parlor of madam, who manifested
such unqualified discomfiture on seeing him, that the
compliment which he had been framing during his
walk, perished before its birth, and he felt called upon
to account for his visit by the phrase of condolence
he had previously conned over with much care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam, I come to condole with you on your
bereavement—’twas a sorrowful bereavement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears came into the eyes of the widowed
lady, but she felt so much relieved at finding Jemmy
was not come to demand possession of the estate,
as she at first had supposed, but was only making a
friendly call in kindness, that it was not in her nature
to take it otherwise than kindly. Her countenance
resumed its usual benevolent expression,
though much saddened of late, as she thanked him
and inquired after “Miss Nancy’s health.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank ye kindly, madam, Nanny’s but poorly
with the rheumatis; she sends her humble sarvice
to you, and hope I see you well.” Then Jemmy
proceeded in his most insinuating manner, to ask if
there was nothing that he or Nanny could do to
“sarve” her, and really appeared so friendly, that
madam was taken by surprise, and out the secret
came; for she thought it would be a fine opportunity
to ask him for a new quit-claim of the whole property,
which, from the great good-will he manifested,
she could not doubt he would readily
give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His object so fully attained, Jemmy, in his elation
became airy, and at length quite softened to the tender.
Placing his brown forepaws upon his knees,
he looked down upon his golden clocks, which he
thought had helped him to win the day, and evading
madam’s request, he turned the subject to her husband’s
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your worthy spouse, madam, died of an arterplax,
(apoplexy?) I take it—a-a-hm—well.” The
compliment was now revived. “A fat sorrow is
better than a lean one—he’s left you well to do in
the world, and sich a parsonable woman as you will
find enough ready to supply his place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smirk which had been frightened away on
his entrance, again returned to adorn his lanthern
jaws, giving Madam Fayerweather, in indignant
amazement, some reason to imagine he contemplated
offering himself as a candidate for the place he alluded
to, with small doubts of being a favored one.
She rose, and all the Borland blood mounted to her
face. The bell-rope was jerked with a violence
wholly unnecessary, for Scipio made his appearance
before the bell could sound in the kitchen; he and
Vi’let having, on Jemmy’s first entrance, stationed
themselves in the passage between the parlor and
kitchen, and had heard through the keyhole all
which had passed. The guest, however, thought
good to make a precipitate retreat without waiting
for the ceremony of being shown the door. As he
passed by the side-gate, Vi’let stood ready to salute
him with a ladleful of some liquid, taken from a
kettle on the kitchen hearth, which all the plates
and dishes, as they had come from the table, had
passed through to restore them to their native purity,
leaving behind them their impurities floating on the
top; and as the rich compound splashed over the
skirts of his coat and his silken hose, with gold
clocks, she cried after him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to take Misser Fayerweather’s place,
do ye! ye old skinflint—well, see how you like a
sup of Vi’let’s broth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stung with his unceremonious dismission; his
legs smarting with the scalding liquor, Vi’let’s insult
was more than he could bear. Turning round
in a rage, he called out, doubling up his fist and
shaking it at her—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell your proud jade of a mistress she wont hold
her head so high long, on other people’s ground!
And as for you! ye nigger”—he made use of an epithet
which would not appear polite here—“I’ll have
you up to the whipping-post!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vi’let answered him with a scornful laugh, as she
slammed the gate after him. Poor madam was overwhelmed
with mortification and chagrin at her own
folly, of which she was fully sensible as soon as she
had committed herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Jemmy proceeded home, his keen sense of indignity
wore off in the exulting thought of vengeance
in full prospect. He and his precious sister, however,
had one great drawback to their satisfaction;
the necessity of opening their purse-strings sufficiently
wide to draw therefrom a fee large enough
to induce any man of the law to undertake the case
against Mr. Wendell, who was regarded throughout
the province as the head of the profession. But a
lawyer was at length found at the distance of twenty
miles, who was willing to engage in the cause for a
moderate share of the profits, if successful, and to
lose his fee if not; and the trial was prepared to
come on at the annual November court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It occasioned a great sensation at the bar, from
the amount of property involved, and the respective
characters of the plaintiffs and defendant; the latter
being Mr. Wendell, as executor to the deceased.
He determined to plead the cause himself, assisted
by a friend as junior counsel. At the first trial, little
difficulty was found in having it postponed a year,
to give time to hear from Captain Fayerweather;
much to the disappointment of the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most intense anxiety was now felt by the
Fayerweather family, and all connected with it, to
hear from George; but as it was known he was to
embark from Europe on a voyage of discovery in
the South sea, small hopes were entertained of receiving
letters from him for many months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To return to a more pleasing subject—Judith was
the darling of all. As her character became more
matured with her person, both increased in loveliness,
and both received a new charm from the cultivation
of her intellect, which proved of no common
order. George’s presents to her were chiefly of
books; for though his active life prevented him from
being a great reader himself, the whole atmosphere
in which he had been born and educated, the circle
of which he was the pride when at home, being intelligent,
he was anxious that deficiency in this point
should not be found in Judith. No deficiency of any
kind, however, was discovered in her by his family.
John regarded her with an affection scarcely less
than George’s; and though the idea of supplanting
his brother, or of Judith’s ever being more to him
than a sister, never crossed his mind, he formed no
other attachment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Stimpson, now grown somewhat stiff in
his limbs, gave up his lookout in the cupola to Judith,
and was at some expense to have it fitted up
for her with cushions and curtains, and a spy-glass
for her particular use. Her sleeping apartment
opened directly at the foot of the stairs which led to
it; and here with her books and her Eolian harp, she
passed all the time which she felt to be exclusively
her own. Her prospect was that of the harbor,
opening into the ocean, under every aspect a noble
one—with Baker’s island, and its light-house in the
distance, on one side, and several hamlets at different
distances on the other; the town, with its then
few streets and scattered dwellings, and the level
country beyond. The view offered little of the
beautiful, the romantic or the picturesque; but all
that was wanting its fair beholder’s imagination
could supply; and it may be questioned whether a
view of the bay of Naples even, with all its magnificence
of scenery, could give rise to conceptions of
more beauty in some minds, than were formed in
Judith’s by the ordinary one of Salem harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time went on, and it was now near the end of the
summer preceding the November, when the cause
was to come on at the Ipswich court. Letters had
twice been received from Captain Fayerweather,
but of a date prior to his leaving Europe, and arrivals
were looked for every day, which were expected
to bring answers to the information that had
been dispatched to him of all which had occurred to
his family since his departure. One fine evening,
Judith, having finished all her domestic tasks for the
day, below stairs, ascended to her observatory,
thinking she should not be missed; her father having
set out on his daily visit to the rope-walk—<span class='it'>en amateur</span>,
for the captain had retired from business—her
grandfather was quietly reposing in his chair, and
her mother holding sweet communion with her
dearly beloved Nanny Dennis—Mrs. Brayton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching her airy retreat, the fair maiden took
the spy-glass, and adjusting its tube, strained her
vision over the ocean, hoping to espy the mast of
some vessel coming into port. In vain—the curve
of the wide horizon was unbroken even by a speck.
A gentle sigh escaped her as she spoke; “Not yet;
well, it must come before long.” She then took
her book, and was soon luxuriating in the fairy-land
of poetry. From time to time her eyes wandered
from the page, to cast themselves over the expanse
of waters before her, glowing beneath the sky of
twilight, and scarcely dimpled by a breath of wind,
as the tide still advanced to fill the broad basin, and
broke in low ripples on its now brimming edge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darkness at length came on, and being no longer
able to distinguish its characters, she laid aside her
book, and turned her eyes and thoughts to the scene
without. Insensibly almost to herself, her ideas
arranged themselves in measure, and she repeated
in a low whisper:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>She stopped, feeling almost like a culprit detected
in some flagrant misdemeanor; but as new images
rose in her mind unbidden, and seemed to plead for
a permanent existence, she continued,</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Gathering courage, she proceeded:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Thinking whether she should ever dare confess

<p class='pindent'>“Judy! Judy!” roared her father’s voice, “come
down directly!—here’s letters from Captain Fayerweather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang, and was down stairs, almost before
the last syllable had left her father’s lips. He stood
with the packet in his hand, which he told her came
by the way of Beverly. On carrying it to the light,
it was discovered to be directed to John Fayerweather.
Judith felt something a little like disappointment,
though she had no reason to expect it
would be directed to herself. “But how was she
to get her own letter to-night—if there was one
for her.” This, if not on her lips, was in her
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father took the packet from her hand; “Here,
I’ll take it up in town myself; I should like to be the
one to give it to them, and you shall have your own
letter to-night.” Without waiting for an answer,
off he set, and his sturdy stump—stump—stump,
was heard the whole length of the street, until he
turned the corner. Judith almost quarreled with
the feeling of delicacy which had forbade her accompanying
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town clock struck ten as Captain Stimpson
reached Paved street, and with a louder and quicker
stump—stump—stump, he hastened on. Just before
he reached the Fayerweather mansion, he met
Mr. and Mrs. Wendell coming from thence, and on
learning his errand, they turned back with him.
The eagerness with which John seized the packet,
and the beating of the heart which all felt as they
gathered round him while he opened it, may be
readily imagined. It contained but two letters, his
own and one to Judith. He handed the latter to
her father, who immediately departed with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first opening of John’s letter proved a bitter
disappointment to all, for the date was only a week
subsequent to that of the packet, which had been
last received. In that one George had not written
to his brother, and to supply the omission, he appeared
to have seized upon another opportunity
which occurred directly after, by a different route.
This letter was a very long one, and bore marks of
the strong affection which subsisted between the
two brothers. One passage in it, however, had a
strong negative bearing upon the lost papers. It ran
thus: “My father’s little trunk, which I took with
me, to hold the letters I expected to receive from
home, is still <span class='it'>empty</span>; not one have I received since
I left Salem.” This, Mr. Wendell said, was <span class='it'>prima
facie</span> evidence that the deeds were not in their
original place of deposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning another thorough search was
made, which proved as fruitless as the preceding
ones, leaving Mr. Wendell and John in a state of
perplexity scarcely to be imagined; the former,
however, resisting all internal misgivings as to the
final issue of the cause, and maintaining his conviction
that the papers would be found in time to be
produced on the trial. Captain Fayerweather was
not expected home until the next spring. Throughout
the whole affair his mother had discovered a
strength of mind scarcely expected from her, and
assisted in all the researches with great energy. A
spirit had been roused in her by Boynton’s insult, as
she felt it, which proved a radical cure for all disorders
on her nerves; she never had a fit of hysterics
after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The autumn advanced, but brought no new
arrivals. November came, the court sat at Ipswich,
and the cause of Boynton versus Wendell was third
on the list. The anxiety of all concerned may be
imagined. It would scarcely be supposed that at
this time an object could exist of sufficient interest
to divert, for a moment, the thoughts of Madam and
John from the issue of this trial, which might, and
the probability was now strong that it would, drive
them from the home of their happiest days, with the
loss of an estate, half of which had been twice paid
for. Such an object was, however, found in old
Jaco. He had been declining for some time, and
all the care of the family had been directed to keeping
him alive until his master’s return. As the
weather grew colder, Vi’let had been prevailed upon
to allow him to stay in the kitchen; and much
softened in her nature by her master’s decease, she
made a bed for him behind the settle, and gave him
warm milk several times a day with her own hand,
without once debating the question of his having a
soul, and the sinfulness of making him comfortable,
if he had not, as she might have done years agone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon, some days before the cause was to
be tried, John received a hurried note from Mr.
Wendell, who was at Ipswich on business; the note
was dated the day before, and expressed some fears,
which he had never allowed to appear before, as to
the issue of the trial. “His hopes,” the note said,
“still predominated, but he thought it would be
best for John not to allow his mother to be buoyed
up by them, but to endeavor to prepare her for the
worst.” The student, with a heavy heart, left the
office and went home to seek his mother. He felt
relieved on finding she had lain down after dinner,
and had at length fallen asleep, after having passed
several wakeful nights. He would not awaken her,
but went out to see old Jaco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor brute lay panting, and was now evidently
drawing near his end. At John’s approach
he turned his head toward him, feebly wagged
his tail, and gave a low whine. After a while he
rose on his feet, and staggered to the door, which
John opening, the dog made out to reach the middle
of the yard, when he fell and lay gasping. His
master bent over him, and gently patting him, spoke
soothingly; at which Jaco opened his eyes and
made a feeble attempt to lick the kind hand which
caressed him. At this instant a light breeze swept
by; and as John felt it wave the hair on his brow
and flutter for a moment on his cheek with the feeling
of the balmy spring, it was singularly associated with
recollections of his brother, whose image it brought
to his side with all the vividness of reality. As,
like a light breath, it passed to Jaco, the dying
animal started suddenly and rose on his haunches,
snuffed eagerly in the air three times—stopped—then
gave one long-protracted howl, when he fell,
quietly stretched himself out to his full length—and
poor Jaco lay stiffening in death. John watched
him for a minute or two, when a low sob might have
been heard from him as he turned away, and took
his course through the garden and fields to the
water side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judith, on this afternoon, felt a weight on her
spirits, wholly unknown to her before. She could
not entirely conceal her depression from her parents,
and they were not surprised at it, in the present juncture
of affairs in the Fayerweather family. She,
however, could not have given this as the cause of
her depression, had it been inquired of her, for this
day her mind had been less occupied with the trial,
and its probable issue, than it had been for a week
previous, and she felt unable to account for the sadness
which oppressed her. Her father, at length,
went out to see if he could not pick up some news,
and Judith, after in vain attempting to rally herself,
went up to her little cupola.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked from her window, but the aspect of all
without seemed in accordance with her feelings.
The sky of one leaden hue, looked as if no sun had
ever enlivened it, and the sea beneath of a darker
shade, heaved and tossed as if sullenly brooding over
some storm in recollection. The wind whistled
through the bare branches of the trees before the
house, and drove a few withered leaves to and fro on
the terrace, then found its way within doors, and
moaned through the passages. Some groups of boys,
as they went from house to house, to gather a few
pence for their bonfire (it was the fifth of November),
at another time, might have seemed to add some little
liveliness to the scene; but to Judith, their voices as
they reached her ear from below, had a melancholy
tone, as they chanted their rhymes, and the tinkling
of their little bells sounded doleful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She placed her harp in the window; for a minute
or two the strings were silent, and she repeated her
accustomed little invocation—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Ye winds that were cradled beyond the broad sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>Come stoop from your flight with your errand to me;</p>
<p class='line0'>And softly the strings of my harp as ye blow,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall whisper your tidings of weal or of wo.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The wind appeared to answer her summons but
fitfully at first, the strings jarring without music, as
it swept over them. The blast increasing in strength,
the tones became for a while loud, harsh, and discordant;
then, as it blew more steadily, they gradually
blended into harmony, and at length, sent to her
ear a strain of such deep melancholy, as struck despair
into her heart. Suddenly there was a crash,
succeeded by the <span class='it'>tolling of a distant bell</span>. So profound
was the illusion of the spell-bound hearer, that
she did not perceive the snapping of a string, which,
by the striking of its loose fragment over the others,
produced the sounds so full of wo, to her saddened
spirit. They ceased, and the harp was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again its tones were heard, faintly, and as from
afar; but gradually drawing nearer, as a gentle gale
passed over the chords to the dejected girl. It fluttered
round her, soft as the breath of a summer evening,
kissed her fair brow and delicate cheek, and
waved each golden curl which hung round her white
throat, while a solemn strain arose, and softening by
degrees to a melody of more than earthly beauty, as
it seized upon her entranced senses, dispelled every
cloud from her spirits, and poured into her soul peace
and joy. Then as the breeze which bore it appeared
to depart, and wing its way back over the ocean, the
tones seemed to syllable the word, farewell, repeated
each time with more sweetness, until the sounds
were lost in distance. When Judith descended, her
parents were rejoiced to see the dark shade dispelled
from her brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wendell sat up late on the preceding night,
preparing a defense in a case, in which all the vigor
of a powerful intellect was called forth, aided by profound
legal learning. He retired to rest, weary, but
not dispirited, confident that a few hours repose
would fully restore him. But after sleeping heavily
until late the next morning, he awoke, not refreshed
with slumber, as was his wont, but feeling a languor
wholly unknown to him before. He, however,
would not succumb to the feeling, but rose, determined
to conquer it; took a walk, and used violent
exercise, which was of benefit, for when he returned
he ate his breakfast with a good appetite, and then
sat down to examine his notes. The seat of his indisposition
was now apparent, for on his first attempt
to read, he felt a pressure on his brain, and a confusion
of ideas, which rendered his mind wholly incapable
of following any train of argument, and scarcely
able to take in the sense of what he had written.
The only course now remaining to him, he adopted,
which was to leave this case in the hands of the junior
counsel, to have it, if possible, continued over
to the Spring term; after doing which, he mounted
his horse and proceeded homeward, leaving word
that he would return in time for the Fayerweather
case. For the first time in his life he felt gloomy
and depressed. The exercise of riding was grateful
to him, and he felt refreshed. After riding an hour
or two, his spirits rose to their accustomed buoyancy,
though his ideas still remained confused, when he
attempted to pursue a train of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He arrived in Salem about three o’clock in the afternoon—the
same afternoon the poor dog Jaco died.
At he was proceeding through the main street, or
reaching the one which turned down to the wharves,
his horse suddenly snorted and became restive. He
patted and soothed his old servant, and then looked
round to discover the occasion of so unwonted a
freak, when he saw a powerfully built man in the
garb of a seaman, who appeared to be advancing toward
him. He stopped his horse with great difficulty,
and the stranger came within a few yards of
him. What was his surprise and joy on seeing
George Fayerweather?</p>

<p class='pindent'>His exclamation was stopped short by the horse
giving a plunge, which, if Mr. Wendell had not sat
well in his saddle would have thrown him. Captain
Fayerweather’s countenance discovered marks of
alarm and distress as he drew nearer, and while he
spoke to Mr. Wendell, the horse snorted and again
plunged fearfully, and at length reared, and stood
nearly upright; but his master sat firm as if glued to
the saddle, while he listened to George’s hurried
account of where the deed was. As Captain Fayerweather
finished, he turned away quickly, and the
animal again put his fore-feet to the ground. As Captain
Fayerweather turned the corner, Mr. Wendell
called after him, and then finding all endeavors to
make the horse follow him, vain, he dismounted and
gave the bridle into the hands of a man whom he
knew, and who at this juncture came up. He then
turned the corner too, but George was gone. His
communication, however, in spite of the restiveness
of the horse, had reached the ears of Mr. Wendell,
and now absorbed all his faculties, as he hastened
home with a rapid pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this afternoon, Mrs. Wendell sat at work in her
parlor, her mind full of the event of the trial, and revolving
over many plans for her aunt, on its now probable
issue. She was thinking over her Aunt Brinley’s
proposal, that the three families should make but
one, and should occupy her house, which was sufficiently
large; when some one opened the front door,
and came immediately into the room. It was her
husband, looking excessively pale, and his whole appearance
betokening hurry and agitation. Scarcely
heeding her, he went to a large closet in the room,
where he kept books and papers, and where her uncle’s
ebony cabinet was placed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her questions of surprise and alarm she could
only obtain in reply—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot answer you now, my love, wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to the cabinet, and proceeded to take out
the three small drawers of the centre, which he
placed on the floor, and then narrowly examined the
vacancy they left. Unable to restrain her curiosity,
she looked over his shoulder. As he knelt, he just
made out to discover a small projection at the back,
to which he applied two of his fingers, and the whole
partition slipped down, and discovered a narrow cavity
in the very centre of the cabinet. Two papers
appeared, tied together with red tape; one of which
was discolored as if with age. He clapped his hands
with a joy strangely contrasted with his pallid countenance,
and both exclaimed at once—she with a
scream—“Here they are! the deeds! the deeds!
found at last!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wendell then mentioned to his wife his meeting
with George, who he supposed had just landed;
and might have gone to see Judith before he went
home. Mrs. Wendell expressed her joy at her
cousin’s return, and then again remarked her husband’s
paleness, and anxiously inquired the cause;
but he made light of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, I am well enough,” he said, “but I sat up
late last night—and perhaps,” he said, with a faint
smile, “it was the fright my horse gave me, while
George was speaking. He nearly threw me, and
prevented my saying a word until George was gone—but
I must return immediately to Ipswich; these
papers must be produced in court to-morrow. I little
thought when I came away, of returning in such
triumph; but, good-bye, my love; I cannot stop a
moment;” and off he hurried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wendell immediately flew into her aunt’s,
whom with John she found in utter ignorance of
George’s return. When informed of it, and of the
discovery of the lost papers, her joy almost overcame
her. In her impatience to see him, she thought Judith
was almost unkind to detain him so long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She might come with him,” she said, and John
started up, and set off to bring them both. On his
way, he met Captain Stimpson, who, he found, had
neither seen nor heard any thing of his brother,
though just returned from home. He, however, was
laden with tidings of high import, and was coming
up in town to tell his news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vessel had that afternoon put in at Beverly with
government dispatches; and staying only long enough
to send them on shore, had set sail for Quebec. The dispatches
were of so much importance, that an express
was immediately sent off with them to Boston, and
it was supposed they were the forerunners of peace.
The vessel was expected to return to Salem in a
month. This was the rumor which Captain Stimpson
brought, for it was but a rumor, of which every one
down in town was full; but of which, no one appeared
to know either the origin or grounds. The
name of the vessel, or of its master, could not be ascertained.
The worthy relator accompanied John
home, and the four there assembled, concluded with
one voice, and almost one feeling of deep disappointment,
that the Captain of the vessel must have been
George, and that being under orders to proceed to
Quebec, with the least possible delay, he would not
trust himself to come home, or to see Judith, for fear
of being detained too long. His not explaining himself
to Mr. Wendell was accounted for, Mrs. Wendell
said, by the restiveness of the horse, which probably
did not allow him to say more than was barely
sufficient for the finding of the papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, the cause at Ipswich was decided
at once, by Mr. Wendell’s producing the deeds.
And heavy were the costs which fell upon the plaintiffs;
their counsel retaining no recollection—there
being no witnesses to it—of the agreement to lose
his fees, should he fail to gain the cause; he expressing
at the same time a high-minded indignation
at having been taken in to engage in a case, in which
so much knavery was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Jaco! I ’clare it makes me sithe to think
on him.” And Vi’let sighed audibly, when Peter
removed his mat from the kitchen. Poor Jaco’s remains
were respectably interred in the garden, under
his absent master’s favorite tree, with a stone to
mark the spot, setting forth his useful life and many
virtues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pleasantly passed the month in Paved street, in
anticipation of George’s return: the smiles returning
to his mother’s countenance, which had seldom
visited it since his father’s death. And pleasantly
glided by the hours to Judith; but how—in her eyrie,
watching the waves which were soon to bear her
lover to her, and invoking the winds to speed his
course? Not she—she taxed herself with selfishness,
in having already spent so much time, engrossed by
her own feelings, and not in administering to the
happiness of others; and she resolutely determined
not to go up into the cupola, take the spy-glass into
her hand, nor even to consult the golden fish, which
surmounted the highest peak of Captain Brayton’s
house as a weathercock—which latter she could do
by only looking out of the east-room window—until
she had made up for lost time, and finished several
pieces of work she had on hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Solomon Tarbox, seeing there was no hope
for him with Judith, had paid his addresses to Miss
Ruthy Philpot, the daughter of a ship-chandler in the
neighborhood, and their nuptials were near at hand.
Judith had set up a patch-work quilt in the summer,
as a bridal present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was high time it was completed,” she
said. So every afternoon, after her household cares
for the day were over, she sat herself at her patch-work
in the sitting-room, and with her lively chatter
shed the sunshine of her own happy spirits over her
parents and grandfather. At the end of three weeks
the quilt was completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a beauty it was,” Ruthy said, when Judith
surprised her with it, and taking it from the arms of
the boy who brought it, unfolded it before her admiring
eyes. “And the pattern of the quilting, too,
in shells—so much genteeler than herring-bone—it
was the handsomest present she had had yet; but
her thanks should be paid when Judith should be
in the same case; which would be before long, no
doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Judith returned home, how beautiful every
thing appeared to her. The first snow had fallen
the night before, and spread over the ground its pure
white mantle, the hue of her own bright spirit;
and blithe as a young snow-bird she flitted along, so
lightly, that one had almost wondered to see the
print of her fairy foot. As she looked up into the
clear blue sky, how could she help the dazzling of
her eye by the golden fish, when it was directly before
her, and the sun shone full upon it; and how
was it possible for her not to see that it’s head
pointed due east? At the sight, who can tell what
sudden thought sent a brighter flush to her cheeks,
already glowing with spirits and exercise, and
quickened her footsteps homeward? On reaching
the house, before disarraying herself of her scarlet
cloak, she bounded up to her cupola, and took the
spy-glass into her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glass was adjusted to her eye, and slowly
turned to every point of the eastern horizon; but the
line marking the meeting of the bright blue heaven
and the dark blue sea remained whole and unbroken.
But no!—is not that a speck? It is—and it increases
and nears! Her start sent the glass from
her hand; when again adjusted, she could plainly
perceive three masts rising from the waves; and
now the swelling sails emerge, and now the dark
hull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judy! do you see that sail?” called Captain
Stimpson from below, in the voice of a speaking-trumpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, sir,” answered Judith from aloft. And now
the whole ship was visible, gracefully moving over
the waters, and proudly and beautifully she bore
herself. The father and daughter watched her progress
from the first speck they could discern in the
bay, until she cast anchor in the harbor, Mrs.
Stimpson having indulgently delayed tea for them,
to which they now sat down; it being so dark they
could see no longer. After tea, Judith sat down to
her work, and endeavored to be tranquil. “It was
wholly uncertain,” she said to her father, “whether
this were Captain Fayerweather’s vessel or not;”
and she really tried to persuade both him and herself,
that she thought in all probability it was not.
Her ears, however, would perversely listen to every
noise from without, which her imagination mischievously
converted into the voices of the busy
crew from the vessel, plainly distinguishing a well-known
one among them, though far out in the harbor.
Captain Stimpson was sure it was the vessel,
and that they should see George that evening; and
so thought Mrs. Stimpson. Their daughter very
undutifully said, “It was not at all probable, even
if he had come—and she felt almost sure he had not—that
he would be willing to leave his mother so
soon, even if she would let him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening wore on, and the little group were
undisturbed. Judith could not repress a gentle sigh
at thinking how rightly she had judged. Her father
at length started up, and said, “He’d make certain
whether the chap had come or not;” and accordingly
put on his galoches, and was going for his
cloak—(his daughter usually brought it for him, but
she did not do it just then)—when footsteps were
heard on the terrace. Judith disappeared from the
room. There was a loud knock at the door, and
Captain Stimpson went to it. On his opening it,
Mrs. Stimpson heard his hearty and vociferous,
“How are you, my lad?” and hastened to give her
welcome with voice, hand, and tears, to the tall,
stout man whom her husband ushered in. Her
joyful greeting was received in silence, and with
no answering marks of recognition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This cannot be Captain Fayerweather,” she
said, turning to her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Fayerweather? No, madam, my name
is Brown,” said the stranger, gravely. He seated
himself, as invited, and there was a pause which
neither Captain nor Mrs. Stimpson felt able immediately
to break. At length the stranger said, “I
am mate of the Dolphin, Captain Richard Seaward,
master; and he desired me to tell you, he
would himself have brought the intelligence I am
to give you, but he is sick, and was obliged to take
to his bed as soon as he came ashore.” Mr. Brown
stopped and cleared his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He resumed. “You took me for Captain Fayerweather;
what I have to say is concerning him.
Captain Fayerweather took passage from London
in the Dolphin; and he told Captain Seaward that
he had just arrived from the Cape of Good Hope,
where he had found letters from home, which rendered
it necessary that he should return with all
possible dispatch; and that finding a vessel at the
Cape ready to sail for London, he had left his own,
which had a consort, to the charge of the second
officer and an experienced crew, to proceed into
the Pacific, and had taken passage in the one to
London, hoping there to find some opportunity of
going to America. We set sail from London on the
third of November—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Stimpson interrupted him. “On the
third of November, did you say—and with Captain
Fayerweather on board? That can’t be true, sir—he
was here on the fifth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger answered gravely, “Sir, the business
Captain Seaward sent me upon, is any thing
but trifling. The Dolphin certainly sailed from
London the third of November, and with Captain
Fayerweather on board; all the crew will testify to
this. But did I understand you rightly to say, he
was here on the fifth? How—at what time? Who
saw him—did you? There must have been some
mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Stimpson, much surprised, replied, “I
did not see him myself, but his cousin, Squire
Wendell, did. He met him in the street between
three and four in the afternoon. There could have
been no mistake, for he told the squire something of
great importance to his family, that nobody but himself
could have known. The vessel we supposed
he came in, put in at Beverly; she staid only long
enough to deliver some dispatches for government,
and sailed directly for Quebec, intending to return
here in a month. We supposed fully that your
vessel was the one, and we were expecting Captain
Fayerweather when you came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the captain spoke, Mr. Brown showed
marks of astonishment and agitation. He was
silent a few moments, though his lips moved, and
he appeared to be making some calculations. At
length he spoke, in a voice apparently from the
depths of his chest, slowly and distinctly, but turning
pale as he proceeded. “On the fifth of November,
two days sail from London, about eight
o’clock in the evening, which, allowing for difference
of longitude, corresponds to between three and
four here, in a raging storm, Captain Fayerweather
fell from the mast-head into the sea, and was lost!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judith’s shriek was heard from the inner-room,
but before her parents could reach it, she had fallen
senseless on the floor. Her father took her in his
arms, while her mother bathed her temples. On
reviving, she held up her clasped hands imploringly
to her mother, and asked if she had heard aright,
and if her ears had not deceived her. Poor Mrs.
Stimpson was incapable of answering her, excepting
by tears; and her father could only clasp her
more closely. “Oh! he’s gone then;—let me go,
too;” and she struggled to free herself. “But
where! where shall I go?—what shall I do? Why
did you bring me to?—it would have been better
for me to have died. I do not wish to live! Why
did you not let me die? I will die!—I will not
live!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father now blubbered outright. “And would
you leave your poor old sir, and your ma’am, that
have their lives bound up in you, and that would
die, too, without you? Have you no love left for
them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do love you both,” she cried; “but now—oh,
George! I wish I was in the depths of the sea
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! sinful child,” sternly said her grandfather,
who had left his chair and now stood before her,
his trembling, withered hand held up in reproof;
“receive this dispensation of the Lord as a massy;
he has taken from you your idol, that was a robbing
him of your heart; turn to him on your bended
knees, and implore His pardon for your sin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she heard him, she appeared by a strong effort
only, to suppress a scream. “Oh! spare me now,
grandfather,” she cried; and she threw herself on
the floor, where she lay with her arm over her face,
whilst sobs convulsed her whole frame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too hard upon her, grandsir,” cried her
mother, with some asperity, and smarting for her
child; “you forget she is young flesh and blood;
but you are such a saint, and you live so much for
another world, that you make no allowance for a
poor young creature’s feelings in this, when her
heart is almost torn out of her body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child,” said the old man, trembling, “you ere
cutting on me with a sharp knife! I, a saint! oh, you
don’t know nothing of the wickedness of this old
heart; that it was my own sinfulness I was a rebuking,
when I was so harsh with this dear child; for
I confess it—and it is with shame and confusion—that
I have thought more of her being among the
grand of the airth, of her riding in her chariot, dressed
in vain attire of silks and satins, and adorned with
pairls and jewels of fine goold, than of the welfare
of her immortal soul. And I verily believe,” he
continued, the tears which had long been strangers
on his usually placid face, now running down his
furrowed cheek, and his whole countenance working
with distress, “I verily believe for my sin, this
has fallen upon us all; and oh! that this old white
head had it all to bear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stimpson was entirely subdued by this
humble confession of her father-in-law, whom she
had always regarded as so near perfection, and so
much above all human weakness, that her affection
for him had been chilled by a feeling partaking of
awe. “Oh, grandsir!” she said, “how cruel I’ve
been to you; but I never knew how tender-hearted
you were before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child, you have always been good to me,”
returned the old man; “and better than I desarve;
but let us pray that this affliction may be sanctified
to us all, and wean us from the perishing things of
this airth—myself above all, who can’t have much
longer to stay; and this dear child, that she may
feel it as a goolden thread a drawing on her easy
like to heaven.” He then knelt down, his son and
daughter-in-law by his side, and offered up an humble
and fervent prayer over Judith, who was lying before
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the paroxysms of her grief appeared
to abate by degrees, and during her grandfather’s
prayer her lips moved as if accompanying him; her
sobs became less frequent, and at length were heard
no longer; her slow and regular breathing showing
that she had fallen into a profound sleep. Her
father brought a pillow and tenderly placed it beneath
her head. She slept heavily for more than
an hour, when, it being long after midnight, her
parents, fearing she would take cold, removed her
into their own bed—this room being their sleeping
apartment in the winter season. As she moaned on
being disturbed, her mother soothed and caressed
her; and then placing herself by the side of her child,
she folded her in her arms, and lulled her to sleep,
as if again an infant, while her father placed himself
in the easy-chair, and watched until sleep overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, as the anxious parents were
bending over their darling, she opened her eyes, and
a beautiful smile spread itself over her features.
“Oh! I have seen him to-night,” she said, “and he
was among the blessed; he told me to live for your
sake and his mother’s, and he would watch over
me until we met in heaven.” When thoroughly
awakened from her dream, she looked fondly on her
father and mother, and clasping the hands of both,
said, “Oh! how wicked and ungrateful I was to
you last night! Can you forgive me? and henceforth
I will only live to please you, and will have no
wish but yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, dear child, you never did any thing but
please us; you never had any other wish but ours,”
both answered with streaming eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judith then arose and dressed herself; her trembling
limbs and pale countenance sufficiently betraying
the shock her frame had received. She went
out of the room and busied herself even more than
was her wont in domestic details, and throughout
the day endeavored by redoubled attention and affection
to her grandfather, to make amends to him for
her impatience the night before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fine weather of the preceding day had been
succeeded in the night by a driving snow-storm,
which had increased to such violence by morning, as
to prevent any communication with the Fayerweather
family during the day. Toward evening
the wind shifted to the south, bringing a rain which
lasted till the next day, melting the great quantity
of snow which had fallen, and rendering the streets
impassable. Judith’s sense of duty, aided by active
and unremitting occupation, had so far enabled her
to struggle against any further indulgence of her
grief. Her parents were surprised at the composure
she maintained, while she sat down this afternoon,
as was frequently her wont, on a low stool by her
grandfather’s side. She had a large basket by her,
filled with new cloth of different kinds, which her
mother and she had cut out, and had already begun
to make into various articles, in preparation for her
own housekeeping. She selected a damask table-cloth
from the basket, and turning the hem, began to
sew. After taking a few stitches, her wonted smile
flitted over her countenance and raised her drooping
eyelids; her dimples began to play, and her voice
broke forth, like the first robin of the spring, in a
lively little Scotch song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of her own voice in singing restored
her to her recollection—she threw down her work
and exclaimed with a scream, “What am I doing?”
then laid her head sobbing on her grandfather’s
knee. “Oh, grandfather! I cannot help it,” she
cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t try to help it, dear,” said her mother, her
own eyes streaming; “you have put force enough
upon yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man placed his withered hands fondly upon
her head, and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, weep, my child, for you may; but not
without hope; He that wept at the tomb of Lazarus
sees you, and in his own good time will turn your
weeping into joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unusual sound of wheels was at this moment
heard, and the Fayerweather chariot drove up to the
terrace. Dr. Holly and Mrs. Wendell alighted, but
Judith feeling herself unable to meet them, retreated
from the room before they were ushered in. Mrs.
Wendell was so much overcome, that for a few
moments she was unable to speak, and it fell to
Dr. Holly to tell their errand. He made very particular
inquiries in regard to Judith’s health, and
how she had sustained the shock of the late afflictive
intelligence, and then proceeded to mention that
Madam Fayerweather was in a very alarming state,
having neither changed her position, eaten or slept,
since the evening before the last, and that he had
accompanied Mrs. Wendell to see if Miss Judith
could feel herself equal to returning with them, in
the hope that the sight of her might have a favorable
effect on madam, in whom if a change could not
speedily be induced, he felt himself called upon to
say, the worst might be apprehended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stimpson immediately replied—“She would
answer for her daughter, that she would feel it a
solace to her own feelings to see Madam Fayerweather,
even if she could not be instrumental in
restoring her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wendell then said—“The sight of Judith
would, if any thing could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stimpson left the room, and in a few minutes
returned with her daughter. At sight of Mrs. Wendell,
who fondly kissed her, Judith’s tears burst forth,
but she made no hesitation in accompanying her
home. As the chariot drove through the street the
contrast of her present feelings with those with
which she had passed it two days before, struck her
forcibly, but she resolutely turned her thoughts from
herself to the stricken one whom she was going to see.
When they arrived at the house, John came out and
assisted them to alight; he pressed Judith’s hand but
could not speak. Dr. Holly was desirous to try his
experiment without delay; they therefore proceeded
immediately to the apartment of his patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On seeing Madam Fayerweather Judith’s strength
suddenly failed her and she came near falling; but
recollecting how much might depend on her retaining
in some degree her self-possession, she made a strong
effort over herself, and went forward to the easy-chair,
where sat the bereaved mother. The latter
was, in truth, not an object to be looked upon without
emotion, even by a stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So rigid and motionless was her countenance, that
it appeared as if changed into stone; her eyes were
fixed; and her hair which, before this last blow, had
retained all its gloss and beauty, was turned to an
ashen hue, giving a strange and unearthly appearance
to her pallid features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister,” said Madam Brinley, who sat by her,
“here’s your dear child, Judith—will you not look
at her and speak to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judith, from a sudden impulse, threw herself on
her knees before the bereaved mother, clasped both
her hands in her own and bathed them with her
tears, but endeavored in vain to speak. Sobs were
heard from all present. Madam raised her head, and
as she did so, her eyes falling upon Judith, immediately
showed a sense of her presence; their fixed
and glassy look was changed to one of intelligence,
the muscles around her mouth then moved, and she
appeared as if endeavoring to articulate. At length
she spoke, but in a voice hollow and strange—“We’ve
had sad tidings, my child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her whole countenance now appeared working;
the frozen fountain of her grief was at length softened,
and burst forth in a torrent of tears and sobs
and groans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the state of exhaustion succeeding this outbreak,
she was prevailed upon to take some food
which Judith brought her; after which she fell asleep
and was carried to her bed, from which she did not
rise for several weeks. She had suffered a severe
paralytic shock, which affected her limbs and speech
for many months, though she finally recovered. Judith,
in the meanwhile, divided her time between
this, her second mother, and her own family.</p>

<hr class='tbk128'/>

<p class='pindent'>What were the sensations of Mr. Wendell on
hearing the appalling tidings, that at the moment
in which his senses had figured to him George
Fayerweather face to face, and whose voice he still
felt burnt as it were into his brain—at that very
moment, thousands of miles distant, the spirit of his
young friend was in the act of departing in a death
so fearful! Had such an incident been related to
Mr. Wendell, from a source however authentic, he
would either have totally disbelieved it, or have considered
it an instance of singular coincidence of an
illusion, occasioned by bodily indisposition, occurring
at the same moment with the death of another
at a great distance. But the feeling which even now
raised the hair on his head, which curdled his blood
and blanched his cheek anew at the bare recollection
of that meeting, as it recalled sensations which his
mind was too intent upon its important subject to
heed at the time, gave the lie to his reason whenever
he attempted so to argue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wendell, however, never spoke upon the subject
himself, and by the family it was avoided altogether;
each one feeling it of too awful and sacred
a nature to admit, not only of discussion, but even
of allusion to it in conversation. But as might be
supposed, so remarkable an occurrence occasioned
no little sensation throughout the town and its neighborhood.
It was noted down, with its date, in
many a private memorandum as the extraordinary
event of the year in which it happened, with remarks
upon it, either devout or philosophical, or
both, according to the different characters of the
minds which severally dictated them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all danger for the life of Madam Fayerweather
was over, and Judith ceased to have in her
an immediate object of care and anxiety, her own
health, no longer sustained by extraordinary stimulus
to exertion, at length gave tokens of the injury it
had itself received. She fell into a state of languor
and debility, which threatened to end in consumption,
had not her strength of mind, aided by a deep
sense of religion, enabled her to exert all her energies
to struggle against the foe and finally to subdue
it—her own melancholy. Her religious duties, those
which she owed to her parents and those to society,
she had always faithfully discharged, and now finding
them insufficient to engross her mind and prevent
it from preying upon itself, she had recourse to the
cultivation of her taste and the higher powers of her
fine intellect. In this she was assisted by John,
already an elegant scholar, and she became a highly
accomplished woman, as well as the most beautiful
in the province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed on, and in its course saw Mr. Wendell
presiding on the bench as chief-justice, his place
as head of the bar filled by John Fayerweather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not surprising that years of devotion from the
latter, combined with all the affection of his mother
for her departed son, now resting on Judith, should
at length have prevailed upon her to be united to
them by stronger ties; after having refused many
offers, and among the first, one from Mr. Lindsey,
who had returned to America as soon as the intelligence
of George’s death reached him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Judith’s becoming the wife of John, there was
no infidelity in either to the memory of his brother;
it was cherished by both during life, and by each in
the heart of the other.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>[WITH A STEEL ENGRAVING.]</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY HENRY WILLIAM HERBERT.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was the evening of a sultry summer’s day,
while the sun was yet hanging suspended, as it
were, in a wreath of lustrous, gauzy vapor scarce a
hand’s-breadth above the horizon. The skies were
perfectly cloudless; and, but for that rich, golden
haze which floated in the west about the sloping
day-star, there was not a speck of mist to be seen
over the whole expanse of the firmament, which,
glowing, as it was, with the warm light of that soft
southern region, resembled more a vault of exquisitely
shadowed gems than the unfathomable depths
of ether. All to the westward, the horizon was
deluged with a flood of golden glory, too soft to be
called intense, yet so vivid that the eye could
scarcely brook it; melting as it streamed upward
toward the zenith, by imperceptible degrees, into
the radiance of the living sapphire; and thence deepening,
through the azure tints of the Lapis Lazuli,
into the darkest cærulean blue to the eastward,
against which rose distinct, glittering with the last
reflected sunbeams, the distant summits of the Cordoran
mountains. Above these, soaring slowly upward,
and momently gathering fresh brilliancy as
the sun faded in the west, the full, round moon had
already risen, with the evening-star at her side, a
diamond spark beside an orient pearl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was the earth below less gracious than the
heaven above it; for the scene, over which that
cloudless sun was setting so serenely, was no other
than the lovely vegas of Granada, watered with its
sparkling rivulets, tributaries to the broad and fair
Xenil; waving with its almost tropical luxuriance
of foliage, odorous with the sweets of ten thousand
gardens—verily the paradise of earth surrounding, as
with a girdle of immortal beauty, the loveliest of
earthly cities, crowned by the wonder of wonders,
the glorious Alhambra. So much has been already
written in many tongues, both in prose and verse, of
the glories of this inimitable spot—still inimitable,
even under the indolent and careless culture of the
Spaniard, yet how unlike to what it was under its
Moorish masters—above all so eloquently has it been
described by the graceful pen of Irving, that all the
details of its scenery, nay! of its architecture and
internal decorations, are, it may be presumed, as familiar
to the mind of the reader, as many places
which he has actually seen with his own eyes. To
dwell longer, therefore, on the features of that sweet,
mountain-girdled plain on which the sunbeams lingered,
as though they loved it, would be superfluous
at least, if not impertinent. Not so, to depict one
who gazed across that plain under that lovely sunset,
soft herself as the genial clime, serenely bright
as the calm eventide—the Lady Ayesha, a princess
of the unmixed race, a visitor from the distant walls
of Mequiñez to the kindred royalty, which in the
person of the unfortunate but as yet unconquered
Boabdil, still sat sublime on the fairy towers of the
Alhambra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat alone in a small octagonal apartment in
the very summit of one of the loftiest of the palace
turrets, overlooking and commanding a view so extensive,
that the eye swam dazzled or ere it
reached the hills, which bounded it on every side.
Walled, vaulted, floored with pure snow-white marble,
all wrought and pierced with that exquisite
arabesque tracery, which made the cold, hard stone
resemble the finest and most delicate lace-work;
lighted on each of its eight sides by a tall window,
headed by the peculiar horse-shoe arch of Moorish
architecture, and surrounded a little lower down the
turret by a balcony, filled as a hanging garden with
every loved and lovely plant and flower, no happier
retreat could be devised for Southern beauty; none
half so beautiful, half so luxurious, is dreamed of in
her most voluptuous musings by the most famed
fair one of our utilitarian days and country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the extreme height of the tower,
which rose full a hundred feet above the inferior
buildings of the royal residence, it yet possessed its
fountain, fed from a reservoir in the roof, itself
supplied by the aid of machinery from the sources of
those silver rivulets of the Xenil and Darro, which
might be seen glittering in the level plain almost a
thousand feet below; and the constant merry plash
of its sparkling waters, as they leaped and fell in a
shower of diamonds into their alabaster basin, together
with the waving of the broad, fan-like palm-leaves
in light coming air around the open casements,
and the rich clusters of clematis, passion-flower
and jessamine which hung their blossoms
around every traceried column, rendered it difficult
to conceive that so great a distance intervened between
that bower of beauty and the solid earth, with
all the choicest charms of which it was environed
and invested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half-seated, half-reclining on a broad, low step of
marble, which ran all around the apartment, covered
with rich cushions and foot-cloths of brocade, such
as would now be cheaply purchased at its weight in
gold, with her shoulders supported by the low parapet
of the window immediately behind her, gazed
the Lady Ayesha over the glimmering landscape, all
as she untwined with the rosy, henna-tinted tips of
her small, slender fingers the thick plaits of her luxuriant
raven hair. For in truth, and for once, the
epithet <span class='it'>raven</span> was not misapplied to those soft, silky,
glistening masses, which were not of the cold and
hueless black, but of that nameless and indescribable
hue which is never seen but in the hair of women
of Moorish or Irish blood—and in the latter probably
as originated of the former—black indeed, but
black warmed and glowing with a rich metallic purplish
lustre, unlike any thing on earth but the changeful
hues that dance on the dark plumage of several
of the feathered tribes. But though her long, languid
eyes of that perfect almond form, so much
prized by the beauty-loving Moors, fringed with
lashes so long and dark as to require no aid of that
Arabian <a id='dye2'></a>dye to set off the liquid lustre which they
curtained, were riveted with a serene and steady
fixedness on a remote spot in the plain, it was by
no means evident that they took note of that on
which they lingered; nor did she even appear conscious
of her occupation, as wave after wave of her
soft tresses fell disentwined into her lap. For there
was too much of tranquillity, approaching even to
abstraction, in the fixedness of her eye, in the statue-like
immobility of her perfectly regular features, and
in the whole pose of her figure, to accord with any
thoughts so frivolous as those of the mere decoration
of the person, how beautiful soever it might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As one gazed on her—had there been any there to
gaze—it was impossible not to perceive that, within
that fair form and under those impassive features,
there was—what with Oriental women is not at all
times the case—a sentient and intellectual soul, and
that soul at this time engrossed in some deep and
powerful strain of meditative thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And oh! how beautiful she was. The perfect
oval of her regular face, the straight, Grecian outline
of her chisseled features, the dark clearness of
her pure, transparent complexion, through which,
though ordinarily colorless, every transient motion
of the blood mantled in crimson, the slender, yet exquisitely
rounded figure, the soft curves of her plump
and shapely arms, were all as nearly perfect as mortality
can approach to perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dress, moreover, which she wore—as far removed
as possible, by the way, from the ungraceful
and hideous monstrosity which a set of crazy notoriety-mongers
have been striving to introduce among
us as the costume of Oriental ladies—set off her
foreign-looking charms by its own foreign eccentricity,
no less than by the barbaric splendor of its
materials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A low, flat Fezzan cap of rich crimson velvet, superbly
embroidered in gold and pearls, was set
lightly, a little on one side, upon her luxuriant black
tresses, and from it depended a long tassel, exquisitely
wrought of grains of native gold and seed-pearls,
down to her left shoulder, contrasting in strong
relief the glossy darkness of the hair, by the brilliancy
of its white and gold. Immense pendants of
pearl hung from the roseate tips of each small ear,
and a string of the same inestimable gems, not one
of them inferior in size to a large currant, formed
four distinct necklaces upon her chest, beside a fifth
and longer coil, which hung down almost to her
waist. A <span class='it'>jellick</span>, as it was called, or, as we should
term it now, a chemisette of the finest Indian muslin,
wrought as its name indicates at Mosul on the
Tigris, embroidered with threads of gold, alone
covered her glowing bosom; but above it she wore
an open, sleeveless Dymar of gorgeous green brocade,
with hanging filigree buttons of gold; and shrouding
all her lower limbs, to the very tips of the small,
slippered feet, as she lay half-crouched on her divan,
an under robe or tunic of blush-colored Persian silk
with broad, perpendicular stripes of dead gold, the
sleeves of which, close to the elbow, fell thence downward,
open like those of the modern gown worn by
bachelors of arts. No appearance of trowsers, no
marked cutting line, nothing tight or definite or
rigid, nothing harsh, stiff or masculine was to be discovered
on the nearest scrutiny. A superb Cashmere
shawl was wound about her waist at the junction of
the under robe and chemisette, and its loose ends
blended admirably with the floating draperies and
harmonized with the wavy ease which was the principal
characteristic of the dress, the attitude, the
pose, the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To complete the picture, a Moorish Bernoose, or
mantle of scarlet woolen, almost as fine as gauze,
with borders of golden lace, lay heaped behind her;
and nestled in its folds, a filigree jewel-case with
boxes and bottles of perfumes and cosmetics, and
half-open drawers of glittering gems and ornaments
befitting her high rank; while on the parapet, beside
her head, stood a huge vase of superb porcelain filled
with the dark, glossy leaves and snow-white blossoms
of the gold-eyed lotus, the perfume of which
would have been too strong for endurance but for the
free circulation of the balmy air on every side, and
the cool freshness of the dashing water, which mingled
with its overpowering fragrance and dissipated
its intensity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the Leila Ayesha, the daughter of the
Sultan of Mequiñez, the great Muley Abderahman,
the best and bravest of his race; who in this, almost
the last extremity of his kinsman, Boabdil of Granada,
had sent an embassy with compliments and
splendid gifts, accompanying and conveying his fair
child, the best loved of all his children, on her visit
to the heroic mother of the last Moorish king of
Granada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By many, however, of those who might be supposed
the best informed on state affairs, both of those
at Mequiñez and those at Granada, it was whispered
that, under the cover of a mere complimentary embassy
and friendly visit something of deep policy, and
that of the highest import to both sovereigns, was
intended. Indeed it was the general opinion that
the object of the Sultan of Morocco in thus sending
his fair daughter—in whom it was well-known that
wise and enlightened prince placed far more confidence
than is usually extended to the sex among the
Moors—was to bring about, should it be pleasing to
the beautiful Ayesha, a union between the two royal
houses, in which case he would himself come to the
aid of Granada with such a force of Moslem, backed
by such hordes of the wild Berbers as Ali Ibn Tarih
himself never led to conquest—such, in a word, as
should soon compel the proud and encroaching Ferdinand
to look to the safety of his own throne and
the integrity of his own dominions, rather than to
the invading <a id='ofthe'></a>of the dominions of his neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Be this as it may, it was all a new world to the
Leila Ayesha, for the Moors of Spain during their
many centuries of occupation, aggrandisement and
decline, had adopted many ideas, many customs
from their Christian neighbors, at one time their
foes, at another in long intervals of truce, their neighbors
and almost their friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor had the Spaniards failed in the same degree
to profit by the vicinity of the intellectual, polished
and industrious Moors, until the bigotry of these and
the fanaticism of those had given way to more rational
and intelligent principles, and the two nations
met, whether in war or peace, on a common ground
of mutual self-respect and decorum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the Moors had not only laid aside long since
their fanatical war-cry of “The Koran or the
Sword!” but had adopted many of the usages of
chivalry, no longer holding the Christians as dogs,
and slaughtering them without quarter given or
taken, but setting them at honorable ransom, and
even treating them while prisoners on parole as
guests on terms of equality, entertaining them at
their boards, and holding sacred to them all the rights
of hospitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In no respect, however, had a wider change occurred
in the habits of the nation than in the
treatment of their women, who, although not certainly
admitted to the full liberty of Christian ladies,
were by no means immured, as in their native land,
in the precincts of the Harem, “to blush unseen, and
waste their sweetness on the desert air,” but were
permitted, still under the guardianship of duennas,
and with their trains of Indian eunuchs, and further
protected by their veils from the contamination of
unholy glances, to be present at festivals, at tournaments,
nay! even at banquets, when none but the
members of the family or guests of high consideration
were expected to be present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not, by the way, a little singular that almost
in exact proportion as the Moors enlarged the liberty
of their women, by the example of the Spaniards,
did the Spaniards contract that of their own bright-eyed
ladies, by the example of the Moors; and for
many years the rigor of the Spanish duenna was
scarcely inferior to that of the Raid of a Moorish
harem, or the ladies under charge of the one much
more obvious to the gaze of the profane, than the
beautiful slaves of the latter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did not, therefore, the beautiful Leila Ayesha
rejoice and exult in the comparative freedom which
she enjoyed among the liberal Moors of Spain, which
as fitted to enjoy as the favorite child of a wise
father, enlightened far beyond the prejudices of his
nation or his time? In his own younger days he had
been a traveler, had visited Venice and even Madrid,
in both of which cities he had been a sojourner
in the character of ambassador, and had
thus, like the wily Ulysses, “seen the cities of
many nations and learned their understandings.”
Their languages he spoke fluently: he even read
their works, and, although a sincere and faithful
Mussulman, he had learned to prize many of the
customs, to appreciate the principles, and in some
instances to adopt in his heart at least the practices
of the Christians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too wise openly to offend the prejudices of his
people—and nothing would have done so, more decidedly
or more dangerously than any infringement
of the sanctity of the harem—he had not dared, absolute
as he was, to grant to his daughter that full
liberty founded upon the fullness of trust which he
had learned to admire in Venice. Still he had done
all that he could do without offending prejudices or
awakening angry opposition. He had made Ayesha,
from her earliest years, the companion of his leisure
hours; he had educated her in all that he himself
knew, he had consulted her as a friend, he had confided
in her as a human soul, not treated her as the
mere pet and plaything of an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now as she grew up from an engaging child
to a fair marriageable maiden, accomplished, intellectual,
thoughtful, not an irresponsible being, but a
responsible human creature, with the beauty, the
impulsive nature, the passionate heart of the Moorish
girl, but with the reason, the intellect, the soul of
the Spanish lady—Muley Abderrahman, who was
waxing into years, began to doubt whether he had
done wisely in training up the child of Mequiñez,
the offspring of the desert, to the arts, the accomplishments,
the hopes, and the aspirations of the
free Venetian <span class='it'>dama</span>—began to look around him
anxiously to see where he might bestow the hand
of her whom he had learned to cherish and esteem
even above his people or his power. He saw none,
on that side <a id='sideof'></a>of the Mediterranean, with whom she
could be other than a slave—the first and mistress of
the slaves, indeed, but still one of them—a beautiful
toy to be prized for beauty, while that beauty should
yet endure; if faded, to be cast aside into the sad
solitude of neglect for a newer plaything, perhaps to
be imprisoned—as a discrowned and discontented
queen, and therefore dangerous—in some distant and
dim seraglio on the verge of the great burning desert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And was this a fate for the bright, the beloved, the
beautiful, the sage Ayesha?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thence was born the idea of the embassy to Boabdil.
He knew the kings of Granada civilized and
cultivated far before those of Tetuan or Tafilet, or
even Mequiñez or Mecca—he knew that they had
adopted, in many respects, the usages of the Christian
cavaliers, and not least among these, their
chivalrous courtesy and graceful respect for the fair
sex—he knew them powerful and wealthy, and possessed
of a land the fairest on the face of the earth,
the glorious kingdom of Granada. At this time,
although the war had commenced between Ferdinand
and the Moorish princes, which was to
terminate at no very distant day in the total overthrow
of the Saracenic empire in Spain, it as yet
lagged indecisively along, with no preponderance of
this or the other force; nor could there be any doubt
that a declaration on the part of the Sultan of
Mequiñez, backed by the reinforcement of a Moorish
and Berber, and an active naval warfare along the
coasts of Spain, would not only secure Granada
from any risk of dismemberment, but even wrest a
permanent acknowledgment and durable peace from
the Christian kings of the Spanish provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boabdil was at this time formally unwedded, although,
like every other prince or magnate of his
people, he had his wives, his concubines, his slaves
innumerable. He was notoriously a leaner to the
soft side of the heart, a fervent admirer of beauty,
and was, moreover, a kind-hearted, gracious and
accomplished prince. That he would be captivated
by the charms of the incomparable Ayesha, even
apart from the advantages which her union would
bring to himself and to his people, could not be
doubted; and should such an union be accomplished
Muley Abderrahman felt well assured that he should
have obtained for the darling of his heart all that
he desired, freedom of life, a suitable partner, and
security for her enjoyment of all her cherished tastes
and respected privileges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Muley Abderrahman, wiser than any Moslem
father of that age, wiser than most Christian parents
of any age, was not inclined to set down his own
idea of what should be her good, with his absolute
yea! as being her very good. He had, strange thing
for a Moor! an idea that a woman has a soul—strange
and unorthodox thing for a father! an idea
that his daughter had a heart; and that it might not be
such a bad thing after all for her ultimate happiness
that her heart should be in some degree consulted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went, therefore, fancy free and untrammeled
even by the knowledge of her father’s wishes, on a
visit to her kinsfolk of Granada, entirely unsuspicious
that any secret of state policy was connected
with the visit to that land of romance and
glory, of beauty and adventure, which was to her
one long holyday. Of all her train, indeed, there
was but one who was privy to the Sultan’s secret
wishes old Hadj Abdallah Ibn Ali, the eldest of the
sovereign’s councillors, like some, himself a traveler,
and like himself, imbued with notions far
more liberal than those of his time or country. To
him it was entrusted, therefore, while seemingly inattentive
to all that was passing, to observe strictly
every shadow which might indicate whence the
wind was about to blow—to take especial note of
Boabdil’s conduct and wishes, and, above all, to omit
no opportunity of discovering how the fair Ayesha
might stand affected toward her royal cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaily and happily had passed the days, the weeks,
the months—it was still truce with the Spaniard,
and days and nights were consumed in tilts, in tournaments,
in hawking-parties on the beautiful green
meadows of the Vega, beside the bright and brimful
streams, adjuncts so necessary to that royal pastime,
that it was known of old as the “Mystery of
Rivers”—hunting-parties in the wild gorges of the
Alpuxawa mountains, banquets at high noon, and
festivals beneath the glimmering twilight, beneath
the full-orbed moon, that life was, indeed, one long
and joyous holyday. Boabdil was, in truth, of a man
a right fair and goodly specimen—tall, finely formed,
eminently handsome, graceful and affable in manners,
kindly in heart and disposition, not untinctured
with arts and letters, nor deficient in any essential
which should become a gentle cavalier—as a monarch,
when surrounded by his court, and seated in
his place of state in the Hall of Lyons, of a truth
he was a right royal king—as a warrior, in the tilt-yard
his skill, his horsemanship, his management
of all weapons, were the admiration of all beholders.
In the field his gallantry and valor were incontestable.
What, then, was wanting that Boabdil was
not a perfect man, a real cavalier, a very king?
Purpose, energy, will—will that must have its way,
and cannot be denied, much less defeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A prince of a quiet realm, in tranquil times he had
lived honored and happy, he had been gathered to
his fathers among the tears of his people, he had
lived in the memory of men as a good man, an admirable
king, the father of his people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fallen upon evil times, thrust into an eminence
for which he not only was, but felt himself to be
unfit, unequally matched against such an enemy as
Ferdinand, the one weak point outweighed all the
fine qualities and noble virtues; and he lived, alas!
to be that most miserable, most abject of all human
things, a dethroned, exiled, despised king!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And did Ayesha, from beneath the screen of girlish
levity, while seemingly steeped to the lips in the
rapturous enjoyment of the liberty, the life of the
present moment, did Ayesha see and foresee all this?
At least, when Hadj Abdallah Ibn Ali wrote to his
friend and patron the Sultan, and that but shortly
after their arrival, that Boabdil was so evidently
and obviously enamored of his mother’s lovely
guest, that he would not only too eagerly court the
alliance, backed as it was by advantages so kingly,
but that he verily believed he would woo her to
his throne, were she the merest peasant’s child. He
wrote nothing of Ayesha!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he wrote that he could not doubt she had
perceived her royal cousin’s love, and that her manner
toward him was so frank, so free, so unrestrainedly
joyous and confiding, that he was well
assured that all went well, and that she returned
the affection of Boabdil, and rejoiced in his love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Muley Abderrahman, shook his head and
knit his brow, as he read the letter, and muttered
through his thick moustache, “Ay! he is a good
man—a good man is the Hadj Abdallah, and a wise
one, but he knows nothing of a woman’s heart—how
should he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he sent the next dispatches to his old friend
and counsellor, there was a brief private note attached.
“Is the Leila Ayesha,” he asked, “never
grave, never abstracted, never shy, and almost sad—does
she never flee from the gayety of the festival,
the tumult of the chase, into privacy and solitude—does
she never fail to hear when addressed, to see
when encountered—does she never weep nor sigh
when alone—in a word, is she in nowise changed
from what she was at Mequiñez?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the reply came, “Never. Wherefore should
she? Is she not the apple of all eyes, the idol of all
hearts? Her laugh is as the music of the soul, her
eye-glance the sunbeam that enkindles every heart.
She is the star of the Alhambra, the loadstone of the
king’s soul. Wherefore should she weep or sigh?
I have questioned her handmaids—never! Yes—the
Leila Ayesha is changed. In Mequiñez, she was as
a sunbeam thrown on still waters. Here in Granada,
she is the sunbeam thrown on the dancing
fountain, reflecting happy light on all around her.
In Mequiñez, she was as a sweet song-bird, feeding
her soul on her own harmonies in silence. Here in
Granada she is as the sweet song-bird, enrapturing all
within her sphere by the blithe outpourings of her
joyous melodies. Yes—the Leila Ayesha is changed.
My Lord Boabdil loves the Leila Ayesha; the
Leila Ayesha knows it, and is glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Muley Abderrahman shook his head, and pondered
for a while, and muttered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She loves him not—She loves him not. The
Hadj Abdallah is good and wise with the wisdom of
men—but of the hearts of women, he knows nothing—how

<p class='pindent'>And the old king, far distant, saw more of what
was passing in the fair girl’s heart than the wise
councillor who was present—but he judged it best to
tarry and abide the event—and he tarried, but not long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had he been present on that sultry summer’s
evening, and looked upon his lovely child as she sat
gazing out in such serenity of deep abstraction over
the sunny Vega—over the fragrant orange groves and
glowing vineyards, toward the glistening hill-tops of
the Spaniards—his question would have answered
itself, and at the first glance he would have seen
that she loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child had discovered that it had a heart—the
creature had divined that it had an immortal soul—the
child had become a woman—a very woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leila Ayesha loved—but whom? At least not
Boabdil! Happily, not Boabdil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as she gazed, the orb of the gorgeous sun
sank behind the distant hills, and at once—clear,
shrill, and most melodious—up went the voice of
the Muezzins, from every minaret throughout the
gorgeous city, “To prayer, to prayer. There is no
God but God, and Mahomet is his prophet. Faithful,
to prayer, to prayer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And instant at the cry every sound ceased through
the royal residence—every sound through the splendid
city—every sound through the wide Vega.
Every turbaned head was bowed in prayer, and a
sabbath stillness seemed to consecrate the bridal of
the earth and sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ayesha rose from her divan, and while her lips
murmured the words of devotion, and her fingers ran
rapidly over the beads of her Comboloic or Moorish
rosary, a strange, faltering flush ran over her fair
brow. Her orisons ended, she caught some of the
spray of the fountain in the palm of one of her fairy
hands, and scattered it thrice over her long, dark
tresses, on which it glistened in the soft moonbeams;
for the moon now alone occupied the heavens, on
the fragrant hills of the black hyacinth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she resumed her attitude on the divan, but
not her occupation; for the mood of her mind was
altered, and for a while she hummed the burthen of
an old, melancholy Moorish ballad—an old Moorish
love-song, the words of which corresponded in no
small degree to our own, “Oh! willow, willow”—since
the proverb still holds good of burned Morocco
or bright Spain, as of green, merry England—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ere long from the city gates far distant was heard
the din of martial music—first, the deep clang of the
kettle-drums and atabals alone, and the clear flourish
of the silver trumpets which announced the presence
of the king, and these only at intervals above or between
the trampling of hoofs, the clash of armor,
and the cheering of an excited multitude. Anon
nearer and nearer came the sounds, with the clash
of cymbals and the soft symphonies of lutes, and the
clear, high notes of flutes and clarionets among the
clangor of the trumpets, and the brazen rattling of
the drums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearer and nearer yet—and it is now at the Alhambra
gates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started to her feet, and leaned far out of the
embrasure commanding all the city, but her eye
marked one object only, the royal train filing into the
palace gates, from the royal sports on the Vega
ended—and in that train, on but one person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no turbaned head or caftaned form on
which that ardent eye was fixed, now kindled into
all a Moresca’s ecstacy of passion; it was on a tall
Spanish crest and lofty plume. And, as if by a secret
instinct, as her gaze was bent downward to the
horse-shoe arch of the Alhambra gate, his glance
soared upward to the airy turret’s top, and readily
detected what would have escaped a less observant
watcher, the dark eyes of his fair Ayesha gleaming
through the palm-leaves and passion-flowers; their
passionate fire half quenched by the tears of tenderness
and hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His Ayesha—his—the Conde of Alarcos, proudest
grandee of Spain—the favorite child of the Spaniard’s
deadliest foe, the Sultan of Morocco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hadj Abdallah Ibn Ali’s next dispatch contained
much important tidings concerning a twenty
years’ truce to be concluded between the King Boabdil,
of Granada, and the King Ferdinand, of Spain—and
much graver gossip of the noble Conde of Alarcos,
Ferdinand’s ambassador; of his high feats of
arms, and gentle feats of courtesy—of how all the
court admired him, and how the Lady Ayesha
shunned him, and how she was less frequent at the
falconry, less frequent at the chase, less frequent at
the festival, less frequent at the royal banquets—and
how her hand-maidens reported that their mistress
sighed all the time and often wept, and sat long hours
gazing upon nothing, and played no more upon her
lute, nor sung the songs of Islam—and how she was—he
feared—ill at ease, and pining for her native land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Muley Abderrahman read the letter he
shook his head, and muttered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, she loves now, but it is the wrong one—a
Nazarene, a dog,” and he tore his beard and wept.
That night a royal courier rode hard from Mequiñez
to Saleè, and the next day a fleet galley scoured the
way across the narrow seas to the fair shores of
Granada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The embassy should return at once to Mequiñez.
Now hour of delay—too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The embassy had returned the preceding day, but
it was the Spanish embassy: and it had returned,
not to Mequiñez, but to Cordova. And ere his master’s
mandate had stricken terror to the soul of the
Hadj Abdallah, the Spanish bells were chiming for
the wedding of a Moorish maiden, now a Christian
bride; and the Leila Ayesha, of Mequiñez, was the
wife of the noble Conde De Alarcos: nor have I
ever heard that she rued either of the changes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Muley Abderrahman tore his beard, and this
time from the very roots. But his wonted philosophy
still consoled him, and after a little while he
muttered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allah, assist me, that I thought myself so wise—yet
know not the heart of a woman! How should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> the word Life is employed in a double sense to
denote the actions or phenomena by which it is developed,
and the cause of these phenomena, so the
old English word Death is used familiarly to express
two or more meanings. The first of these is the
transition from the living to the lifeless or inanimate
state—the act, that is, of dying; the second, the condition
of an organized body which has ceased to live,
while organization yet remains, and symmetry still
displays itself, and the admirable structure of its parts
is not yet destroyed by decomposition, or resolved
into the original and primary elements from which it
was moulded,</p>

<p class='pindent'>We occasionally speak of “dead matter” in the
sense of inorganic; but this is merely a rhetorical or
metaphorical phrase. That which has never lived
cannot properly be said to be dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the following essay, I shall use the word chiefly
in the first of the senses above indicated. It will
often be convenient to employ it in the second also;
but in doing so, I will be careful so to designate its
bearing as to avoid any confusion. The context
will always prevent any misunderstanding on this
point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Death may be considered physiologically, pathologically,
and psychologically. We are obliged to
regard it and speak of it as the uniform correlative,
and indeed the necessary consequence, or final result
of life; the act of dying as the rounding off, or termination
of the act of living. But it ought to be
remarked that this conclusion is derived, not from
any understanding or comprehension of the relevancy
of the asserted connection, nor from any <span class='it'>à priori</span>
reasoning applicable to the inquiry, but merely <span class='it'>à
posteriori</span> as the result of universal experience. All
that has lived has died; and, therefore, all that lives
must die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The solid rock on which we tread, and with which
we rear our palaces and temples, what is it often
when microscopically examined, but a congeries of
the fossil remains of innumerable animal tribes!
The soil from which, by tillage, we derive our vegetable
food, is scarcely any thing more than a mere
mixture of the decayed and decaying fragments of
former organic being; the shells and exuviæ, the
skeletons and fibres and exsiccated juices of extinct
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The earth itself, in its whole habitable surface, is
little else than the mighty sepulchre of the past;
and</p>

<p class='line0'>The globe are but a handful to the tribes</p>
<p class='line0'>That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings</p>
<p class='line0'>Of morning, and the Barcan desert pierce,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or lose thyself in the continuous woods</p>
<p class='line0'>Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound</p>
<p class='line0'>Save his own dashings—yet, the dead are there;</p>
<p class='line0'>And millions in these solitudes, since first</p>
<p class='line0'>The flight of years begun, have laid them down</p>
<p class='line0'>In their last sleep: the dead reign there alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four millions of Egyptians cultivate the valley of
the great river on whose banks, amidst the fertilizing
dust of myriads of their progenitors, there are calculated
still to exist, in a state of preservation, not less
than from four hundred to five hundred millions of
mummies. The “City of the Tombs” is far more
populous than the neighboring streets even of
crowded Constantinople; and the cemeteries of London
and the catacombs of Paris are filled to overflowing.
The trees which gave shade to our predecessors
of a few generations back lie prostrate; and
the dog and horse, the playmate and the servant of
our childhood, are but dust. Death surrounds and
sustains us. We derive our nourishment from the
destruction of living organisms, and from this source
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And who is there among us that has reached the
middle term of existence, that may not, in the touching
phrase of Carlyle, “measure the various stages
of his life-journey by the white tombs of his beloved
ones, rising in the distance like pale, mournfully receding
milestones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Wilkie was in the Escurial,” says
Southey, “looking at Titian’s famous picture of the
Last Supper in the refectory there, an old Jeronymite
monk said to him, ‘I have sat daily in sight of
that picture for now nearly threescore years; during
that time my companions have dropped off one after
another—all who were my seniors, all who were
my cotemporaries, and many or most of those who
were younger than myself; more than one generation
has passed away, and there the figures in the picture
have remained unchanged. I look at them, till I
sometimes think that <span class='it'>they</span> are the realities, and we
but shadows.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have stated that there is no reason known to us
why Death should always “round the sum of life.”
Up to a certain point of their duration, varying in
each separate set of instances, and in the comparison
of extremes varying prodigiously, the vegetable and
animal organisms not only sustain themselves, but
expand and develop themselves, grow and increase,
enjoying a better and better life, advancing and progressive.
Wherefore is it that at this period all
progress is completely arrested; that thenceforward
they waste, deteriorate and fail? Why should they
thus decline and decay with unerring uniformity
upon their attaining their highest perfection, their
most intense activity? This ultimate law is equally
mysterious and inexorable. It is true the Sacred
Writings tell us of Enoch, “whom God took and he
was not;” and of Elijah, who was transported
through the upper air in a chariot of fire; and of Melchisedek,
the most extraordinary personage whose
name is recorded, “without father, without mother,
without descent: having neither beginning of days,
nor end of life.” We read the history without conceiving
the faintest hope from these exceptions to
the universal rule. Yet our fancy has always exulted
in visionary evasions of it, by forging for ourselves
creations of immortal maturity, youth and
beauty, residing in Elysian fields of unfading spring,
amidst the fruition of perpetual vigor. We would
drink, in imagination, of the sparkling fountain of
rejuvenescence; nay, boldly dare the terror of Medea’s
caldron. We echo, in every despairing heart,
the ejaculation of the expiring Wolcott, “Bring back
my youth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reflection, however, cannot fail to reconcile us to
our ruthless destiny. There is another law of our
being, not less unrelenting, whose yoke is even
harsher and more intolerable, from whose pressure
Death alone can relieve us, and in comparison with
which the absolute certainty of dying becomes a
glorious blessing. Of whatever else we may remain
ignorant, each of us, for himself, comes to feel,
realize and know unequivocally that all his capacities,
both of action and enjoyment, are transient
and tend to pass away; and when our thirst is satiated,
we turn disgusted from the bitter lees of the
once fragrant and sparkling cup. I am aware of
Parnell’s offered analogy—</p>

<p class='noindent'>and of Rush’s notion, who imputes to the aged such
an augmenting love of life that he is at a loss to
account for it, and suggests, quaintly enough, that it
may depend upon custom, the great moulder of our
desires and propensities; and that the infirm and decrepit
“love to live on because they have acquired
a habit of living.” His assumption is wrong in
point of fact. He loses sight of the important principle
that Old Age is a relative term, and that one
man may be more superannuated, farther advanced
in natural decay at sixty, than another at one hundred
years. Parr might well rejoice at being alive,
and exult in the prospect of continuing to live, at
one hundred and thirty, being capable, as is affirmed,
even of the enjoyment of sexual life at that age; but
he who has had his “three sufficient warnings,”
who is deaf, lame and blind; who, like the monk of
the Escurial, has lost all his cotemporaries, and is
condemned to hopeless solitude, and oppressed with
the consciousness of dependence and imbecility,
must look on Death not as a curse, but a refuge.
Of one hundred and thirty-three suicides occurring
in Geneva from 1825 to 1834, more than half were
above fifty years of age; thirty-four, from fifty to
sixty; nineteen, from sixty to seventy; nine, from
seventy to eighty; three, from eighty to ninety; in
all sixty-five. The mean term of life in that city
being about thirty-five to forty, this bears an immense
proportion to the actual population above fifty,
and exhibits forcibly an opposite condition of feeling
to that alleged by Rush, a weariness of living, a desire
to die, rather than an anxiety, or even willingness
to live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I once knew an old man of about one hundred and
four who retained many of his faculties. He could
read ordinary print without glasses, walked firmly,
rode well, and could even leap with some agility.
When I last parted with him, I wished him twenty
years more; upon which he grasped my hand
closely, and declared he would not let me go until I
had retracted or reversed the prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strolling with my venerable and esteemed colleague,
Prof. Stephen Elliott, one afternoon, through
a field on the banks of the river Ashley, we came
upon a negro basking in the sun, the most ancient-looking
personage I have ever seen. Our attempts,
with his aid, to calculate his age, were of course
conjectural; but we were satisfied that he was far
above one hundred. Bald, toothless, nearly blind,
bent almost horizontally, and scarcely capable of
locomotion, he was absolutely alone in the world,
living by permission upon a place, from which the
generation to which his master and fellow-servants
belonged had long since disappeared. He expressed
many an earnest wish for death, and declared, emphatically,
that he “was afraid God Almighty had
forgotten him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot wonder, then, that the ancients should
believe, “Whom the gods love, die young,” and are
ready to say with Southey, himself, subsequently,
like poor Swift, a melancholy example of the truth
of his poetical exclamation,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sacred history informs us that, in the infancy of
the world, the physiological tendency to death was
far less urgently and early developed than it is now.
When the change took place is not stated; if it occurred
gradually, the downward progress has been
long since arrested. All records make the journey
of life from the time of Job and the early patriarchs,
much the same as the pilgrim of to-day is destined
to travel. Threescore and ten was, when Cheops
built his pyramid, as it is now, a long life. Legends,
antique and modern, do indeed tell us of tribes that,
like Riley’s Arabs and the serfs of Middle Russia,
and the Ashantees and other Africans, live two or
three centuries, but these are travelers’ stories, unconfirmed.
The various statistical tables that have
been in modern times made up from materials more
or less authentic, and the several inquiries into the
general subject of longevity, seem to lead to the
gratifying conclusion that there is rather an increase
of the average or mean duration of civilized life.
In 1806, Duvillard fixed the average duration of life
in France at twenty-eight years; in 1846, Bousquet
estimates it at thirty-three. Mallet calculated that
the average life of the Genevese had extended ten
years in three generations. In Farr’s fifth report (for
1844), the “probable duration,” the “expectation of
life” in England, is placed above forty; a great improvement
within half a century. It is curious, if it
be true, that the extreme term seems to lessen as the
average thus increases. Mallet is led to this opinion
from the fact, among others, that in Geneva, coincident
with the generally favorable change above mentioned,
there has not been a single centenarian within
twenty-seven years; such instances of longevity
having been formerly no rarer there than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Birds and fishes are said to be the longest lived of
animals. For the longevity of the latter, ascertained
in fish-ponds, Bacon gives the whimsical reason
that, in the moist element which surrounds them,
they are protected from exsiccation of the vital
juices, and thus preserved. This idea corresponds
very well with the stories told of the uncalculated
ages of some of the inhabitants of the bayous of
Louisiana, and of the happy ignorance of that region,
where a traveler once found a withered and antique
corpse—so goes the tale—sitting propped in an arm-chair
among his posterity, who could not comprehend
why he <span class='it'>slept</span> so long and so soundly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Hollanders and Burmese do not live especially
long; and the Arab, always lean and wiry,
leads a protracted life amidst his arid sands. Nor
can we thus account for the lengthened age of the
crow, the raven, and the eagle, which are affirmed
to hold out for two or three centuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is the same difference among shrubs and
trees, of which some are annual, some of still more
brief existence, and some almost eternal. The venerable
oak bids defiance to the storms of a thousand
winters; and the Indian baobab is set down as a
contemporary at least of the Tower of Babel, having
probably braved, like the more transient, though
long-enduring olive, the very waters of the great
deluge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be delightful to know—will Science ever
discover for us?—what constitutes the difference
thus impressed upon the long and short-lived races
of the organized creation. Why must the fragrant
shrub or gorgeous flower-plant die immediately after
performing its function of continuing the species, and
the pretty ephemeron languish into non-existence
just as it flutters through its genial hour of love, and
grace, and enjoyment; while the banyan, and the
chestnut, the tortoise, the vulture, and the carp,
formed of the same primary material elements, and
subsisting upon the very same resources of nutrition
and supply, outlast them so indefinitely?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Death from old age, from natural decay—usually
spoken of as death without disease—is most improperly
termed by writers an euthanasia. Alas! how
far otherwise is the truth! Old age itself is, with
the rarest exceptions, exceptions which I have never
had the good fortune to meet with anywhere—old
age itself is a protracted and terrible disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During its whole progress, Death is making gradual
encroachments upon the domain of life. Function
after function undergoes impairment, and is less
and less perfectly carried on, while organ after organ
suffers atrophy and other changes, unfitting it for the
performance of offices to which it was originally designed.
I will not go over the gloomy detail of the
observed modifications occurring in every part of the
frame, now a noble ruin, majestic even in decay.
The lungs admit and vivify less blood; the heart often
diminishes in size and always acts more slowly,
and the arteries frequently ossify; nutrition is impeded
and assimilation deteriorated; senile marasmus
follows, “and the seventh age falls into the lean
and slippered pantaloon;” and, last and worst of all,
the brain and indeed the whole nervous tissue shrink
in size and weight, undergoing at the same time
more or less change of structure and composition.
As the skull cannot contract on its contents, the
shrinking of the brain occasions a great increase of
the fluid within the subarachnoid space. Communication
with the outer world, now about to be cut
off entirely, becomes limited and less intimate. The
eyes grow dim; the ear loses its aptitude for harmony,
and soon ceases to appreciate sound; odors
yield no fragrance; flavors affect not the indifferent
palate; and even the touch appreciates only harsh
and coarse impressions. The locomotive power is
lost; the capillaries refuse to circulate the dark,
thick blood; the extremities retain no longer their
vital warmth; the breathing slow and oppressed,
more and more difficult, at last terminates forever
with a deep expiration. This tedious process is
rarely accomplished in the manner indicated without
interruption; it is usually, nay, as far as my experience
has gone, always brought to an abrupt close
by the supervention of some positive malady. In
our climate, this is, in the larger proportion, an affection
of the respiratory apparatus, bronchitis, or
pulmonitis. It will, of course, vary with the original
or constitutional predisposition of the individual,
and somewhat in relation to locality and season.
Many aged persons die of apoplexy and its kindred
cerebral maladies, not a few of diarrhœa; a winter
epidemic of influenza is apt to be fatal to them in
large numbers everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we regard death pathologically, that is, as
the result of violence and destructive disease, it is
evident that the phenomena presented will vary relatively
to the contingencies effective in producing
it. It is obviously out of place here to recount them,
forming as they do a vast collection of instructive
facts, the basis indeed of an almost separate science,
Morbid Anatomy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many of the phenomena of death, however,
that are common to all forms and modes of
death, or are rarely wanting; these are highly interesting
objects of study in themselves, and assume a
still greater importance when we consider them in
the light of signs or tokens of the extinction of life.
It seems strange that it has been found difficult to
agree upon any such signs short of molecular change
or putrefactive decomposition, that shall be pronounced
absolutely certain, and calculated entirely
to relieve us from the horrible chance of premature
interment of a body yet living. The flaccidity of the
cornea is dwelt on by some; others trust rather to
the <span class='it'>rigor mortis</span>, the rigid stiffness of the limbs and
trunk supervening upon the cold relaxation which
attends generally the last moments. This rigidity is
not understood or explained satisfactorily. It is possible
that, as Matteucci has proved, the changes in
all the tissues, chiefly chemical or chemico-vital, are
the source from whence is generated the “nervous
force” during life; so, after death, the similar
changes, now purely chemical, may, for a brief period,
continue to generate the same or a similar
force, which is destined to expend itself simply upon
the muscular fibres in disposing them to contract.
There is a vague analogy here with the effect of
galvanism upon bodies recently dead, which derives
some little force from the fact that the bodies least
disposed to respond to the stimulus of galvanism are
those which form the exceptions to the almost universal
exhibition of rigidity—those, namely, which
have been killed by lightning, and by blows on the
pit of the stomach. Some poisons, too, leave the
corpse quite flaccid and flexible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The researches of Dr. Bennett Dowler, of New
Orleans, have presented us with results profoundly
impressive, startling, and instructive. He has, with
almost unequalled zeal, availed himself of opportunities
of performing autopsy at a period following
death of unprecedented promptness, that is, within a
few minutes after the last struggle, and employed
them with an intelligent curiosity and to admirable
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said that, in physiological death, the natural
decay of advancing age, there is a gradual encroachment
of death upon life; so here, in premature death
from violent diseases, the contrasted analogy is offered
of life maintaining its ground far amidst the
destructive changes of death. Thus, in cholera asphyxia,
the body, for an indefinite period after all
other signs of life have ceased, is agitated by horrid
spasms, and violently contorted. We learn from Dr.
Dowler that it is not only in these frightful manifestations,
and in the cold stiffness of the familiar <span class='it'>rigor
mortis</span>, that we are to trace this tenacious muscular
contraction as the last vital sign, but that in all, or
almost all cases we shall find it lingering, not in the
heart, anciently considered in its right ventricle the
<span class='it'>ultimum moriens</span>, nor in any other internal fibres,
but in the muscles of the limbs, the biceps most obstinately.
This muscle will contract, even after the
arm with the scapula has been torn from the trunk,
upon receiving a sharp blow, so as to raise the forearm
from the table, to a right angle with the upper
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We also learn from him the curious fact that the
generation of animal heat, which physiologists have
chosen to point out as a function most purely vital,
does not cease upon the supervention of obvious or
apparent death. There is, he tells us, a steady development
for some time of what he terms “post-mortem
caloricity,” by which the heat is carried not
only above the natural or normal standard, but to a
height rarely equalled in the most sthenic or inflammatory
forms of disease. He has seen it reach 113°
of Fahr., higher than Hunter ever met with it, in his
experiments made for the purpose of exciting it;
higher than it has been noted even in scarlatina, 112°,
I think, being the ultimate limit observed in that
disease of pungent external heat; and far beyond the
natural heat of the central parts of the healthy body,
which is 97° or 98°. Nor is it near the centre, or at
the trunk, that the post-mortem warmth is greatest,
but, for some unknown reason, at the inner part of
the thigh, about the lower margin of its upper third.
I scarcely know any fact in nature more incomprehensible
or inexplicable than this. We were surprised
when it was first told us that, in the Asiatic
pestilence, the body of the livid victim was often
colder before than after death; but this, I think, is
easily understood. The profluvia of cholera, and its
profound capillary stagnation, concur in carrying off
all the heat generated, and in preventing or impeding
the development of animal heat. No vital actions,
no changes necessary to the production of caloric,
can proceed without the minute circulation which
has been checked by the asphyxiated condition of
the subject, while the fluids leave the body through
every outlet, and evaporation chills the whole exposed
and relaxed surface. Yet the lingering influence
of a scarcely perceptible vitality prevents the
purely chemical changes of putrefactive decomposition,
which commence instantly upon the extinction
of this feeble resistance, and caloric is evolved by
the processes of ordinary delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the admirable liturgy of the churches of England
and of Rome, there is a fervent prayer for protection
against “battle, murder, and sudden death.”
From death uncontemplated, unarranged, unprepared
for, may Heaven in mercy deliver us! But if ever
ready, as we should be for the inevitable event, the
most kindly mode of infliction must surely be that
which is most prompt and brief. To die unconsciously,
as in sleep, or by apoplexy, or lightning, or
overwhelming violence, as in the catastrophe of the
Princeton, this is the true Euthanasia. “Cæsar,”
says Suetonius, “finem vitæ commodissimum, repentinum
inopinatumque pretulerat.” Montaigne,
who quotes this, renders it, “La moins préméditée
et la plus courte.” “Mortes repentinæ,” reasons
Pliny, “hoc est summa vitæ felicitas.” “Emori
nolo,” exclaims Cicero, “sed me esse mortuum
nihil estimo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sufferers by various modes of execution were often,
in the good old times of our merciless ancestors,
denied as long as possible the privilege of dying, and
the Indians of our continent utter a fiendish howl of
disappointment when a victim thus prematurely escapes
from their ingenious malignity. The <span class='it'>coup de
grace</span> was a boon unspeakably desired by the poor
wretch broken on the wheel, or stretched upon the
accursed cross, and forced to linger on with mangled
and bleeding limbs, amidst all the cruel torments of
thirst and fever, through hours and even days that
must have seemed interminable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The progress of civilization, and a more enlightened
humanity have put an end to all these atrocities,
and substituted the gallows, the garrote, and the
guillotine, which inflict deaths so sudden that many
have questioned whether they necessarily imply any
consciousness of physical suffering. These are,
however, by no means the most instantaneous modes
of putting an end to life and its manifestations. In
the hanged, as in the drowned, and otherwise suffocated,
there is a period of uncertainty, during which
the subject is, as we know, recoverable; we dare
not pronounce him insensible. He who has seen an
ox “pithed” in the slaughter-house, or a game-cock
in all the flush and excitement of battle “gaffed” in
the occiput or back of the neck, will contrast the immediate
stiffness and relaxation of the flaccid body
with the prolonged and convulsive struggles of the
decapitated bird, with a sort of curious anxiety to
know how long and in what degree sensibility may
linger in the head and in the trunk when severed by
the sharp axe. The history of the guillotine offers
many incidents calculated to throw a doubt on the
subject, and the inquiries of Seguret and Sue seem
to prove the existence of post-mortem passion and
emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the promptest modes of extinguishing life
is the electric fluid. A flash of lightning will destroy
the coagulability of the blood, as well as the contractility
of the muscular fibre; the dead body remaining
flexible. A blow on the epigastrium kills
instantly with the same results. Soldiers fall sometimes
in battle without a wound; the impulse of a
cannon-ball passing near the pit of the stomach is
here supposed to be the cause of death. The effect
in these two last instances is ascribed by some to “a
shock given to the semilunar ganglion, and the communication
of the impression to the heart;” but this
is insufficient to account either for the quickness of
the occurrence, or the peculiar changes impressed
upon the solids and fluids. Others are of opinion
that the whole set of respiratory nerves is paralyzed
through the violent shock given to the phrenic,
“thus shutting up,” as one writer expresses it, “the
fountain of all the sympathetic actions of the system.”
This hypothesis is liable also to the objections
urged above; and we must acknowledge the
suddenness and character of the results described to
be as yet unexplained, and in the present state of our
knowledge inexplicable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the field of battle, it has been observed that the
countenances of those killed by gun-shot wounds are
usually placid, while those who perish by the sword,
bayonet, pike, or lance, offer visages distorted by
pain, or by emotions of anger or impatience. Poisons
differ much among themselves as to the amount
and kind of suffering they occasion. We know of
none which are absolutely free from the risk of inflicting
severe distress. Prussic acid gives perhaps
the briefest death which we have occasion to observe.
I have seen it, as Taylor states, kill an animal,
when applied to the tongue or the eye, almost
before the hand which offered it could be removed.
Yet in the case of Tawell, tried for the murder of
Sarah Hart, by this means, there was abundant testimony
that many, on taking it, had time to utter a
loud and peculiar scream of anguish: and in a successful
attempt at suicide made by a physician of
New York city, we have a history of appalling suffering
and violent convulsion. So I have seen in
suicide with opium, which generally gives an easy
and soporose death resembling that of apoplexy, one
or two instances in which there were very great and
long-protracted pain and sickness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Medical writers have agreed, very generally, that
“the death-struggle,” “the agony of death,” as it
has long been termed is not what it appears, a stage
of suffering. I am not satisfied—I say it reluctantly—I
am not satisfied with these consolatory views, so
ingeniously and plausibly advocated by Wilson
Philip, and Symonds, Hufeland and Hoffman. I
would they were true! But all the symptoms look
like tokens or expressions of distress; we may hope
that they are not always such in reality: but how
can this be proved? Those who, having seemed to
die, recovered afterward and declared that they had
undergone no pain, do not convince me of the fact
any more than the somnambulist, who upon awaking,
assures me that he has not dreamed at all, after
a whole night of action, and connected thought and
effected purpose. His memory retains no traces of
the questionable past; like that of the epileptic, who
forgets the whole train of events, and is astonished
after a horrible fit to find his tongue bitten, and his
face and limbs bruised and swollen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nay, some have proceeded to the paradoxical extreme
of suggesting that certain modes of death are
attended with pleasurable sensations, as for instance,
hanging; and a late reviewer, who regards this sombre
topic with a most cheerful eye, gives us instances
which he considers in point. I have seen many men
hung, forty at least, a strangely large number. In
all, there were evidences of suffering, as far as could
be judged by external appearances. It once happened
that a certain set were slowly executed, owing
to a maladroit arrangement of the scaffold upon
which they stood, which gave way only at one end.
The struggles of such as were half supported were
dreadful, and those of them who could speak earnestly
begged that their agonies should be put an
end to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In former, nay, even in recent times, we are told
that pirates and robbers have resorted to half-hanging,
to extort confession as to hidden treasure. Is it
possible that they can have so much mistaken the
means they employ as thus to use pleasurable appliances
for the purposes of torture?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mistake of most reasoners on the subject,
Winslow and Hufeland more especially, consists in
this, that they fix their attention exclusively upon
the final moments of dissolution. But the act of
dying may be in disease, as we know it to be in
many modes of violence, impalement, for example,
or crucifixion, very variously protracted and progressive.
“Insensibly as we enter life,” says Hufeland,
“equally insensibly do we leave it. Man can
have no sensation of dying.” Here the insensibility
of <span class='it'>death completed</span>, that is, of <span class='it'>the dead body</span>, is
strangely predicated of the moribund while still living.
This transitive condition, to use the graphic
language of the Southern writer whom we have already
more than once quoted, is “a terra incognita,
where vitality, extinguished in some tissues, smouldering
in others, and disappearing gradually from
all, resembles the region of a volcano, whose eruptions
subsiding, leave the surface covered with cinders
and ashes, concealing the rents and lesions
which have on all sides scarred and disfigured the
face of nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides this, we have no right to assume, as Hufeland
has here done, the insensibility of the child at
birth. It is subject to disease before birth; as soon
as it draws a breath, it utters loud cries and sobs.
To pronounce all its actions “mechanical, instinctive,
necessary, automatic,” in fact, is a very easy
solution of the question; but I think neither rational
nor conclusive. If you prick it or burn it, you regard
its cries as proving sensibility to pain; but on
the application of air to its delicate and hitherto protected
skin, and the distension of its hitherto quiet
lung, the same cry, you say, is mechanical and inexpressive.
So Leibnitz explained, to his own satisfaction,
the struggles and moans of the lower animals
as automatic, being embarrassed with metaphysical
and moral difficulties on the score of their intelligence
and liability to suffering. But no one now espouses
his theory, and we must accept, whether we
can explain them or not, the facts that the lower animals
are liable to pain during their entire existence,
and that the heritage of their master is, from and
during birth to the last moment of languishing vitality,
a sad legacy of wo and suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unhappily we may appeal, in this discussion, directly
to the evidence of our senses, to universal experience
and observation. Who can doubt the tortures
inflicted in tetanus? to alleviate which, indeed,
I have more than once been solicited for poison.
Does not every one know the grievous inflictions of
cancer, lasting through months and years, and continuing,
as I have myself seen, within a short hour of
the absolute extinction of life, in spite of every effort
to relieve it? The most painful of deaths apparently
is that which closes the frightful tragedy of
hydrophobia, and patients, to hurry it, often ask most
urgently for any means of prompt destruction. But
these more intense and acute pangs are not the only
form of intolerable agony. Unquenchable thirst, a
dreadfully progressive suffocation, confusion of the
senses and of thought—these are inflictions that nature
shudderingly recoils from, and these, or their
manifestations, are scarcely ever wanting on the
death-bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any one should ask why I thus endeavor to
prove what it is revolting to us all to believe or admit,
I answer—first, that truth is always desirable to
be known both for its own sake and because it is
ever pregnant with ultimate benefit and utility.
More than one moribund has expressed to me his
surprise and horror—shall I say disappointment too?
at finding the dark valley of the shadow of death so
rough and gloomy and full of terrors. Is it not better
that we should be as thoroughly and adequately prepared
for the stern reality as may be, and that we
should summon up all the patience and fortitude requisite
to bear us through? When the last moment
is actually at hand, we can safely assure our friends
that they will soon reach a state of rest and unconsciousness,
and that meanwhile, as they die more
and more, they will less and less feel the pain of dying.
Secondly, by appreciating properly the nature
and amount of the pangs of death, we shall be led to
a due estimate of the demand for their relief or palliation,
and of the obligation incumbent on us to institute
every proper effort for that purpose with zeal
and assiduity. He who believes with Hufeland, that
the moribund is insensible, is likely to do little to solace
or comfort him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are doubtless instances of death entirely
easy. “I wish,” said Doctor Black, “I could hold
a pen; I would write how pleasant a thing it is to
die.” Dr. George Fordyce desired his youngest
daughter to read to him. When she had been reading
some time, he called to her—“Stop; go out of
the room; I am going to die.” She left him, and an
attendant, entering immediately, found him dead.
“Is it possible I am dying?” exclaimed a lady patient
of mine; “I feel as if going into a sweet sleep.”
“I am drowsy, had I better indulge myself?” asked
Capt. G. On my giving him an affirmative answer,
he turned, and sank into a slumber from which he
awoke no more. It is indeed pleasant to know that
examples occur of this unconscious and painless dissolution;
but I fear they are comparatively rare exceptions
to a natural rule; and I regard it as the duty
of the medical profession to add to the number by
the judicious employment of every means in our
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this leads me to a brief consideration of the
question so often pressed upon us in one shape or
another by the friends of our patients, and sometimes
by our patients themselves: If the tendency of any
medicinal or palliative agent be to shorten life, while
it assuages pain, has the physician a right to resort to
it? Even in the latter stages of some inflammatory
affections, loss of blood, especially if carried to fainting,
will arrest the sharp pangs, but the patient will
probably die somewhat sooner: shall we bleed him?
Large doses of opium will tranquilize him, or render
him insensible; but he will probably sink somewhat
earlier into the stupor of death. Shall we administer
it, or shall we let him linger on in pain, merely
that he may linger? Chloroform, ether, and other
anæsthetics in full dose inspired render us insensible
to all forms of anguish, and make death as easy, to
use the phrase of Hufeland, as being born! Shall
we allow our agonized moribund to inhale them?
Used in less amount, a degree of relief and palliation
is procured, but at the risk of exhausting or
prostrating more promptly the failing energies of the
system. Shall we avail ourselves of their anæsthetic
influences, or are they forbidden us, either absolutely
or partially?</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are by some moralists considered very delicate
questions in ethics. Desgenettes has been
highly applauded for the reply he made to Bonaparte’s
suggestion, that it would be better for the
miserable sick left by the French army at Jaffa to
be drugged with opium: “It is my business to save
life, not to destroy it.” But, in approving the physician,
we must not harshly condemn the commanding
officer. When we reflect on the condition of the
men whom the fortune of war compelled him to
abandon, and the certainty of a horrible death to each
victim from wasting disease or Turkish cruelty, a
rational philanthropist might well desire to smooth
their passage to the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the employment of torture for the purposes
of tyranny in Church and State, a physician or surgeon
was at hand, whose whole duty it was to suspend
the process whenever it became probable that
nature would yield under its pressure, and the victim
would escape through the opening, glad gates of
death. It was then esteemed an act of mercy to
give, or permit to be given by the executioner, a
fatal blow, hence called emphatically and justly the
<span class='it'>coup de grace</span>. In the terrible history of the invasion
of Russia by Napoleon, we shudder to read
that, after their expulsion from Moscow, the French
soldiers, in repassing the fields of battles fought
days and even weeks previously, found many of
their comrades, there wounded and left, still dragging
out a wretched and hopeless existence, amidst
the corpses of those more fortunately slain outright,
and perishing miserably and slowly of cold and hunger,
and festering and gangrenous wounds. One
need not surely offer a single argument to prove, all
must feel and admit that the kindest office of humanity,
under the circumstances, would have been
to put an end to this indescribable mass of protracted
wretchedness by the promptest means that could be
used to extinguish so horrible a life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A common case presents itself from time to time
to every practitioner, in which all hope is avowedly
extinct, and yet, in consonance with uniform custom,
stimulants are assiduously prescribed to prolong
existence in the midst of convulsive and delirious
throes, not to be looked on without dismay. In
some such contingencies, where the ultimate result
was palpably certain, I have seen them at last abandoned
as useless and worse, in order that nature, irritated
and excited, lashed into factitious and transitory
energy, might sink into repose; and have felt a
melancholy satisfaction in witnessing the tranquillity,
so soft and gentle, that soon ensued; the
stormy agitation subsiding into a calm and peaceful
decay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Responsibility of the kind I am contemplating, often
indeed more obvious and definite, presses upon
the obstetrician, and is met unreservedly. In embryulcia,
one life is sacrificed in the hope and with
the reasonable prospect of saving another more valued:
this is done too sometimes where there is an
alternative presented, the Cæsarian section, which
destroys neither of absolute necessity, but subjects
the better life to very great risk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patients themselves frequently prefer the prompter
and more lenient motives of death which our science
refuses to inflict. In summing up the motives of
suicide in one hundred and thirty-one cases, whose
causes are supposed to be known, Prevost tells us
that thirty-four, more than one-fourth of the whole
number, committed self-murder to rid themselves of
the oppressive burden of physical disease. Winslow
gives us an analysis of thirteen hundred and thirty-three
suicides from Pinel, Esquirol, Burrows, and
others. Of these, there were but two hundred and
fifty that did not present obvious appearances of bodily
ailment; and although it is not stated how many
of them sought death voluntarily as a refuge from
physical suffering, it would be unreasonable to doubt
that this was the purpose with a very large proportion.
I am far from advocating the propriety of
yielding to this desire or gratifying the propensity;
nay, I would, on the other hand, earnestly endeavor
to remove or repress it, as is now the admitted
rule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hold fully, with Pascal, that, according to the
principles of Christianity, which in this entirely oppose
the false notions of paganism, a man “does not
possess power over his own life.” I acknowledge
and maintain that the obligation to perform unceasingly,
and to the last and utmost of our ability, all
the duties which appertain to our condition, renders
absolutely incompatible the right supposed by some
to belong to every one to dispose of himself at his
own will. But I would present the question for the
serious consideration of the profession, whether
there does not, now and then, though very rarely,
occur an exceptional case, in which they might,
upon full and frank consultation, be justified before
God and man in relieving, by the efficient use of
anæsthetics, at whatever risk, the ineffable and incurable
anguish of a fellow-creature laboring under
disease of organic destructiveness, or inevitably
mortal; such, for example, as we are doomed to
witness in hydrophobia, and even more clearly in
some instances of cancerous and fungoid degeneration,
and in the sphacelation of organs necessary to
life, or parts so connected as to be indispensable, yet
not allowing either of removal or restoration?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have left myself scarcely time for a few remarks
upon death, psychologically considered. How is the
mind affected by the anticipation and actual approach
of death? The answer will obviously depend upon
and be influenced by a great diversity of contingencies,
moral and physical. The love of life is an instinct
implanted in us for wise purposes; so is the
fear of pain. Apart from this, I do not believe, as
many teach, that there is any instinctive fear of
death. Education, which instills into us, when
young, the fear of spectres; religious doctrines,
which awake in us the terror of “something after
death;” conscience, which, when instructed,
“makes cowards of us all;” associations of a revolting
character—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both these sentiments, whether instinctive or educational,
are, we should observe, very strikingly influenced
by circumstances. Occasionally, they seem
to be obliterated, or nearly so; not only in individuals,
but in large masses, nay, in whole communities;
as during great social convulsions; through the
reign of a devastating pestilence; under the shock of
repeated disorders of the elements; as in earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, storms, and inundations;
in protracted sieges, and in shipwrecks. The Reign
of Terror produced this state of feeling in France,
and thousands went to the scaffold indifferently, or
with a jest. Boccacio and others have pictured the
same state of undejected despair, if such a phrase be
permitted, in which men succumb to fate, and say,
with a sort of cheerful hardihood, “Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we die,” losing thus all dread
even of the plague. Pliny the younger, in his flight
from Mycena, under the fatal shower of ashes from
Vesuvius, heard, amidst the darkness, the prayers
of wretches “who desired to die, that they might be
released from the expectation of death.” And Byron,
in his magnificent description of the shipwreck,
in Don Juan, tells us—</p>

<p class='noindent'>A woman who has lost her honor; a soldier convicted
of poltroonery; a patriot who sees his country
enslaved; a miser robbed; a speculator bankrupt;
a poet unappreciated, or harshly criticized, as in poor
Keats’s case—</p>

<p class='noindent'>all these seem to loathe life, or, at any rate, lose
much of their fondness for it. It is curious to remark,
too, how little, as in the last-mentioned instance,
will suffice to extinguish, abruptly or gradually,
this usually tenacious instinct. A man in York
cut his throat, because, as he left in writing, “he
was tired of buttoning and unbuttoning.” The occurrence
of a loathsome but very curable disease in
a patient of mine, just when he was about to be
married, induced him to plunge among the breakers
off Sullivan’s Island, on one of the coldest days of
our coldest winter. A Pole in New York wrote
some verses just before the act of self-destruction,
implying that he was so weary of uncertainty as to
the truth of the various theories of the present and
future life, that he “had set out on a journey to the
other world to find out what he ought to believe in
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are always interested in observing the conduct
of brave men, who exhibit a strongly-marked
love of life, with little or no fear of death. Danton,
Camille Desmoulins, and Herault Sechelles, who
commenced their revolutionary career as reckless as
they seemed ferocious, having attained elevation,
acquired wealth, and married beautiful women, became
merciful and prudent. Hunted in their turn
by the bloodhounds of the time, they made the most
earnest endeavors to escape, but displayed a noble
courage in meeting their fate when inevitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a trite but true remark, that men will boldly
face one mode of death, and shrink timidly from another.
A soldier, whom discipline will lead without
flinching “up to the imminent deadly breach,” will
cower before a sea-storm. Women, even in the act
of suicide, dreading explosion and blood, prefer poison
and drowning. Men very often choose firearms
and cutting instruments, which habit has made
familiar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the nervous or sensorial system escape lesion
during the ravages of disease, the conduct of the last
hour will be apt to be consistent with the previous
character of the individual. Hobbes spoke gravely
of death as “a leap in the dark.” Hume talked
lightly of Charon and his ferry-boat. Voltaire made
verses with his usual levity—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Adieu, mes amis! adieu, la compagnie!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Dans deux heures d’ici, mon âme aneantie</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Sera ce que je fus deux heures avant ma vie.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Keats murmured, poetically, “I feel the flowers
growing on my grave.” Dr. Armstrong died prescribing
for a patient; Lord Tenterden, uttering the
words “Gentlemen of the Jury, you will find;”
General Lord Hill, exclaiming “Horrid war!”
Dr. Adams, of the Edinburgh High School, “It
grows dark; the boys may dismiss!” The last
words of La Place were, “Ce que nous connaissons
est peu de chose; ce que nous ignorons, est immense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of suicide, of death in battle, and of
executions, is full of such instances of consistent
conduct and character. Madame Roland desired to
have pen and paper accorded to her, at the “Place
de la Guillotine,” that she might, as she phrased it,
“set down the thoughts that were rising in her
mind.” Sir Thomas More jested pleasantly as he
mounted the scaffold. Thistlewood, the conspirator,
a thoughtful man, remarked to one of his fellow-sufferers
that, “in five minutes more, they would be
in possession of the great secret.” When Madame
de Joulanges and her sisters were executed, they
chanted together the Veni Creator on their way from
the prison to the fatal spot. Head after head fell
under the axe, but the celestial strain was prolonged
until the very last voice was hushed in the sudden
silence of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The delirium of the moribund exhibits itself in diversified
and often contrasted manifestations. Symonds
looks upon it as closely analogous to the condition
of the mind in dreaming. A popular and ancient
error deserves mention, only to be corrected;
that the mind, at the near approach of dissolution,
becomes unusually clear, vigorous, and active.</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Excitement of the uncontrolled imagination, as in
dreams, and other modes of delirium, is frequently
mistaken for general mental energy; some suggested
association arouses trains of thought that have made
deep traces in the memory; scenes familiar in early
childhood are vividly described, and incidents long
past recalled with striking minuteness. All physicians
know the difference familiarly presented in
diseases, some of which specifically occasion despondency
and dejection of spirits, while others
render indifferent or even give rise to exhilaration.
The former constitute a class unhappily numerous.
Cholera, which at a distance excites terrors almost
insane, is usually attended with a careless stolidity,
when it has laid its icy hand upon its victim. The
cheerful hopefulness of the consumptive patient is
proverbial; and in many instances of yellow fever,
we find the moribund patient confident of recovery.
These are the exceptions, however; and we cannot
too often repeat that the religious prejudice which
argues unfavorably of the previous conduct and present
character from the closing scene of an agitating
and painful illness, or from the last words, uttered
amidst bodily anguish and intellectual confusion, is
cruel and unreasonable, and ought to be loudly denounced.
We can well enough understand why an
English Elizabeth, Virgin Queen, as history labels
her, could not lie still for a moment, agitated as she
must have been by a storm of remorseful recollections,
nor restrain her shrieks of horror long enough
even to listen to a prayer. But how often does it
happen that “the wicked has no bands in his
death;” and the awful example of deep despair in
the Stainless One, who cried out in his agony that
he was forsaken of God, should serve to deter us
from the daily repeated and shocking rashness of the
decisions against which I am now appealing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some minds have seemed firm enough, it is true,
to maintain triumphantly this last terrible struggle,
and resist in a measure at least the depressing influence
of disease. Such instances cannot, however,
be numerous; and we should be prepared rather to
sympathize with and make all due allowance for human
weakness. I have seen such moments of yielding
as it was deeply painful to witness, at the bedside
of many of the best of men, whose whole lives had
been a course of consistent goodness and piety, when
warned of impending death, and called on to make
those preparations which custom has unfortunately
led us to look upon as gloomy landmarks at the entrance
of the dark valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these, from youth to age a most esteemed
and valued member of one of our most fervent religious
bodies, with sobs and tears, and loud wailing,
threw the pen and paper from him, exclaiming, over
and over again, “I will not—I cannot—I must not
die.” Like the eccentric Salvini, of whom Spence
tells us that he died, crying out in a great passion,
“Je ne veux pas mourir, absolument;” and Lannes,
the bravest of Bonaparte’s marshals, when mortally
wounded, struggled angrily and fearfully, shouting
with his last breath, “Save me, Napoleon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I recoil from farther discussion of a topic so
full of awe and solemn interest, and conclude this
prosaic “Thanatopsis” with the Miltonian strain of
Bryant, who terminates his noble poem, thus styled,
in language worthy of the best age and brightest
laurel of our tongue:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span><h1><a id='art'></a>THE PHILADELPHIA ART-UNION.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>While</span> other Art-Unions throughout the country are
falling into disrepute, that of Philadelphia seems to be
rising in favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This cannot be owing to the absence of discouragements.
Like all similar institutions, it suffered severely
from the pressure of the money-market during the last
six months of the year 1851. It found, in common with
others, that money was not forthcoming for the promotion
of art, when it commanded from one to two per
cent. a month on ’change—that men could not, or would
not buy pictures, when they were obliged to strain every
nerve to save themselves from bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides the serious loss of revenue arising from this
source, the Philadelphia Art-Union lost by fire its two
most valuable steel plates, just at the moment when it
was about to reap from them a golden harvest. These
splendid plates, “Mercy’s Dream,” and “Christiana and
her Family,” which had cost the society several thousand
dollars, and which were unquestionably among the
most attractive prints ever issued in this country, were
entirely destroyed in the conflagration of Hart’s buildings
in this city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not, therefore, mere good luck, nor the absence
of discouraging circumstances, that has given the Philadelphia
Art-Union its present condition of success. This
success is based on the principles of its organization,
which differ materially from those of other kindred
associations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, though located nominally in Philadelphia,
and having its Board of Managers here, it is
really an Art-Union for every place where it finds subscribers.
Its prize-holders may select their prizes
from any gallery in the United States, or may order a
picture from any artist of their own selection. This puts
it entirely out of the power of the Board of Managers,
even if they had the inclination, to exercise favoritism
toward any particular clique of artists, or to practice
any kind of fraud or trickery either in the purchase or
the valuation of pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, and for the very reason just assigned, the
Philadelphia Art-Union enjoys in a high degree the
confidence of the artists themselves. They know by experience
that its free gallery is the means of selling a
large number of pictures, besides those which are ordered
in consequence of the annual distributions. They know
also that in order to sell their pictures, or to obtain
orders for painting, they have not to cater to the fancies
or caprices of a small clique of managers, but to appeal
to the public at large, depending solely upon the general
principles of their art. In other Art-Unions, the managers
themselves select and buy the pictures that are to
be distributed as prizes. Hence they are almost invariably
regarded with jealousy by every artist who
does not receive from them an order—that is, by at least
nine-tenths of the whole body. The artist sees, however,
that the Philadelphia Art-Union does not admit of
any favoritism of this kind. Its very plan renders
the thing impossible. If any particular artist finds that
among the prize-holders, no order or purchase has come
to his studio, he may see in it evidence perhaps that he
has not pleased the public taste, but no evidence of partiality
in the Board of Managers. So far as their operations
are concerned, they give to all competitors “a fair
field and no favor”—and this is all that the artist
asks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That this view of the subject is the true one, and that
the artists themselves so view it, has been conclusively
shown by their action on the occasion of the losses of
the institution by the late fire. The artists of Philadelphia,
on hearing of this disaster, called a meeting, of
their own accord, and passed a series of resolutions, approving
in the most unqualified manner both the plan
and the management of the institution, and agreeing
severally to paint a picture of the value of at least fifty
dollars, and to present the same to the Art-Union.
Several other gentlemen, amateurs and patrons of art,
stimulated by this generosity, joined them in the enterprise,
and already about fifty valuable prizes have been
thus guarantied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is obvious that they have entered upon this matter
in a generous spirit, with that animation and hearty
good-will which spring naturally from the circumstances.
Every one at all conversant with art or artists,
knows how much the excellence of a picture, its very
life and soul—all, in fact, that distinguishes it as a work
of art, or raises it above a mere piece of mechanism—depends
upon the feeling of the artist while creating it.
The noble enthusiasm with which the artists have entered
upon the present arrangement, is the best guaranty
that the Art-Union will have from each painter one of
the happiest efforts of his genius—something done under
the direct influence of inspiration. Indeed, we happen
to know that several of our most eminent artists intend
to lay themselves out on this occasion—resolved to show
what artists are, and what they can do, for an institution
which commands their confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rothermel has signified his intention to paint a
picture worth $500; Mr. Paul Weber a landscape worth
$500; Mr. A. Woodside a picture worth $500; Mr.
Scheussele a Scriptural subject worth $250; Mr. Sully
a picture worth $100; Mr. Joshua Shaw a landscape
worth $75; and several others have promised pictures at
prices varying from $50 (the minimum) to $75, $100,
$150, etc. The names of the other artists and amateurs
who have offered original pictures of this description,
are Rembrandt Peale, James Hamilton, Isaac L. Williams,
Wm. A. K. Martin, Wm. F. Jones, Wm. E.
Winner, Leo. Elliot, F. de Bourg Richards, George C.
White, John Wiser, J. K. Trego, George W. Holmes,
Geo. W. Conarroe, John Sartain, Alex. Lawrie, Jr.,
Samuel Sartain, G. R. Bonfield, S. B. Waugh, W. T.
Richards, Aaron Stein, R. A Clarke, W. Sanford Mason,
J. R. Lambdin, G. C. Lambdin, J. Wilson, May Stevenson,
I. W. Moore, T. H. Glessing, W. H. Wilcox,
Thomas A. Andrews, George F. Meeser, James S.
Earle, Edward F. Dennison, George W. Dewey, James
L. Claghorn. Others will, no doubt, be added to the
list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About fifty splendid original works of art, ranging in
value from $50 to $500 each, have thus been placed absolutely
at the disposal of the Board of Managers, and
have been by them specifically pledged to the subscribers
at the next distribution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides this, Mr. Rothermel has just finished for the
Art-Union a great historical painting of Patrick Henry
making his celebrated revolutionary speech before the
Virginia House of Burgesses. This picture is undoubtedly
Mr. Rothermel’s master-piece. He has thrown
into it all the fire of his genius, all the ardor of his
patriotism, all the accumulations of his knowledge and
skill as one of the practiced and leading historical
painters of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The historical scene which Mr. Rothermel has commemorated
in this painting is the passage of Patrick
Henry’s resolutions on the Stamp Act in the House of
Burgesses, in the year 1765. The passage of these resolutions
was the first bold note of defiance that was
uttered on this side of the Atlantic. The manner in
which they were carried through the House is thus described
by his biographer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was, indeed, the measure which raised him [Mr.
Henry] to the zenith of his glory. He had never before
had a subject which entirely matched his genius, and was
capable of drawing out all the powers of his mind. It
was remarked of him, throughout his life, that his
talents never failed to rise with the occasion, and in
proportion with the resistance which he had to encounter.
The nicety of the vote, on the last resolution,
proves that this was not a time to hold in reserve any
part of his forces. It was, indeed, an Alpine passage,
under circumstances even more unpropitious than those
of Hannibal; for he had not only to fight, hand to hand,
the powerful party who were already in possession of
the heights, but at the same instant to cheer and animate
the timid band of followers, that were trembling, and
fainting, and drawing back below him. It was an occasion
that called upon him to put forth all his strength;
and he did put it forth, in such a manner as man never
did before. The cords of argument with which his
adversaries frequently flattered themselves that they had
bound him fast, became packthreads in his hands. He
burst them with as much ease as the unshorn Samson did
the bands of the Philistines. He seized the pillars of
the temple, shook them terribly, and seemed to threaten
his opponents with ruin. It was an incessant storm of
lightning and thunder, which struck them aghast. The
faint-hearted gathered courage from his countenance,
and cowards became heroes while they gazed upon his
exploits. It was in the midst of this magnificent debate,
while he was descanting on the tyranny of the obnoxious
act, that he exclaimed in a voice of thunder,
and with the look of a god, ‘Cæsar had his Brutus—Charles
the First his Cromwell—and George the
Third—’ ‘Treason!’ cried the Speaker. ‘Treason!
treason!’ echoed from every part of the house. It
was one of those trying moments which is decisive of
character. Henry faltered not for an instant; but rising
to a loftier attitude, and fixing on the Speaker an eye
of the most determined fire, he finished his sentence with
the firmest emphasis—‘<span class='it'>may profit by their example</span>.
If <span class='it'>this</span> be treason—make the most of it!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exact moment of time which Mr. Rothermel has
seized for his painting, is when the last words which
we have quoted, (“<span class='it'>If this be treason—make the most of
it!</span>”) are dying away upon the ear. The impassioned
orator stands erect and self-possessed, his open hand
aloft, as though a thunder-bolt had just passed from his
fingers, and his eye were quietly awaiting the issue, in
the conscious strength of a Jupiter Tonans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Foremost in the foregoing is Richard Henry Lee.
Lee sees, by a sort of prophetic intuition, the full import
of this inspired oratory. His very face, under the
magic of Mr. Rothermel’s genius, is a long perspective of
war, desolation, heroic deeds, and the thick-coming
glories of ultimate civic and religious liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peyton Randolph, also in the foreground, is a most
striking figure. So is Pendleton, so is Wythe, so is
Speaker Robinson. Indeed, every inch of canvas tells
its story. The spectator, who knew nothing of the
scene or of its actors, would instantly and involuntarily
become conscious that he was present at some great
world-renowned action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in dwelling upon this fascinating topic, we have
been unconsciously carried away from our main point.
This great painting, which was executed by Mr. Rothermel
for the Art-Union, at the price of one thousand
dollars, but which, by its extraordinary excellence, has
already acquired a market value far beyond that sum, <span class='it'>is
to be drawn for among the other prizes at the next annual
distribution</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every subscriber, moreover, secures for himself a
copy of the engraving of this great picture, which the
Managers have contracted for in a style of surpassing
beauty. The picture itself, and the engraving of it,
will form an era in the history of American art, as the
subject itself did in the history of American Independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides this, all the money obtained from the subscribers,
after paying for the engraving and other incidental
expenses, is to be distributed, as heretofore, in
money-prizes for the purchase of other works of art, at
the option of the prize-holders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the general beneficial influence of Art-Unions, at
least of those conducted on the plan of that in Philadelphia,
we have not the shadow of a doubt. We
are happy, however, to quote a couple of passages
quite in point. The first is from the <span class='it'>North British
Review</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We believe that by a judicious distribution of
engravings more may be done for the culture of the
public taste than by any other means whatsoever. One
thoroughly good engraving, fairly established and domiciled
in a house, will do more for the inmates in this
respect, than a hundred visits to a hundred galleries of
pictures. It is a teacher of form, a lecturer on the
beautiful, a continually present artistic influence. Nor
do we see any reason why the same system should not
be extended to casts, which might be taken either after
the antique, or some thoroughly good modern sculptor,
such as Thorwarldsen. If such a system were carried
out, matters might soon be brought to a state in which
there should scarcely be any family which did not possess
within its own walls the means of forming a taste,
and that a genuine and a high one, both in painting and
sculpture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second passage is still more to the point. It is
from our contemporary, the <span class='it'>Saturday Courier</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Institution, [The Philadelphia Art-Union,] by
its Free Gallery, and by its being a centre of action for
artists and amateurs, is continually operating in a silent
but most perceptible manner upon public taste. Every
visit to the Free Gallery, every picture sold from its
walls, every picture which it is the means of calling into
existence, every print which it sends abroad into the
community, is so much done toward the promotion of a
popular taste for what is refined and elegant, and a consequent
<span class='it'>dis</span>taste for what is coarse, illiberal, and depraved.
Every man in the community has on interest—not
merely a moral, but a pecuniary interest—in the
promotion of a popular taste for the Fine Arts. It is a
part of the moral education of society, which, like all
other good popular education, adds at once to the value
and the safety of every man’s property.”</p>

Sir James Stephen, K. C. B., LL. D.; Professor
of Modern History in the University of Cambridge.
New York: Harper &amp; Brother. 1 vol. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sir James Stephen is the writer of a number of essays
in the Edinburgh Review, which, at the time they appeared,
were mistaken by some readers as the productions
of Macaulay. There were no real grounds for such
a supposition, as Stephen’s mind has hardly a single
quality in common with Macaulay’s, and the resemblance
of his style to that of the historian of the Revolution is
of a very superficial kind. Stephen, like Macaulay, is a
writer of clear, clean, short, compact sentences, and
deals largely in historical allusions, parallels and generalizations,
but his diction has none of Macaulay’s rapid
movement, and his knowledge betrays little of Macaulay’s
“joyous memory.” Stephen’s mind is large and
rich in acquired information, but it is deficient in passion,
and its ordinary movement is languid, without any of
Macaulay’s intellectual fierceness, eagerness and swift
sweep of illustration and generalization, and without
any of Macaulay’s bitterness, partizanship and scorn of
amiable emotions. Stephen, indeed, if he be a mimic,
mimics Mackintosh rather than Macaulay, and in charity,
in intellectual conscientiousness, in courtesy to opponents,
in all the benignities and amenities of scholarship,
and also in a certain faint hold upon large acquisitions,
he sometimes resembles without at all equaling
him. The reader is continually impressed with his
honesty and benevolence, with his continual clearness
and occasional reach of view, and with his graceful mastery
of the resources of expression; but to continuous
vigor and vividness of conception and language he has
no claim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present volume, a large octavo of some seven
hundred pages, is evidently the work of much thought,
research and time, though the author regrets that he was
compelled to prepare his lectures without adequate preparation.
They were delivered at the University of
Cambridge, Stephen occupying in that institution the
professorship of history. He succeeded, we believe,
William Smythe, a dry, hard and pedantic, though well
read professor, whose lectures on history and on the
French Revolution are the most uninteresting of useful
books. Stephen is almost his equal in historical knowledge,
and his superior in the graces of style and in the
power of making his knowledge attractive. His work,
indeed, though it can hardly give him the reputation of a
great historian, is altogether the best view of French
history in the English language, and is an invaluable
guide to all who wish to gain a thorough acquaintance
with France in her historical development. It gives
the causes of the decline and fall of the various dynasties
of her government, the character of her feudal system,
the steps by which her government became an absolute
monarchy, and the differences between the absolute monarchy
of Henry IV. and Louis XIV. The lectures on
the anti-feudal influence of the municipalities, of the
Eastern Crusades, of the Albigensian Crusades—the
masterly view of the position occupied by the Parliaments,
the Privileged Orders and the States General, in
relation to the Monarchy of France—and the expositions
of the sources and management of the revenues of the
nation, are all eminently lucid and valuable, and without
any of the ostentatious brilliancy and paradoxical generalization
which are apt to characterize the French historical
school, are really modest contributions to the
philosophy of history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir James Stephen, in the course of his narration and
dissertations, furnishes us with some elaborate delineations
of character. That of Cardinal Richelieu is especially
good. After saying of him that he was not so
much minister as dictator, not so much the agent as the
depositary of the royal power, he adds that, “a king in
all things but the name, he reigned with that exemption
from hereditary and domestic influences which has so
often imparted to the Papal monarchs a kind of preterhuman
energy, and has so often taught the world to deprecate
the celibacy of the throne.” His character, as
a despotic innovator, is also finely sketched. “Richelieu
was the heir of the designs of Henry IV. and ancestor
to those of Louis XIV. But they courted, and were
sustained by, the applause and the attachment of their
subjects. He passed his life in one unintermitted struggle
with each, in turn, of the powerful bodies over
which he ruled. By a long series of well-directed blows,
he crushed forever the political and military strength of
the Huguenots. By his strong hand the sovereign courts
were confined to their judicial duties, and their claims
to participate in the government of the state were scattered
to the winds. Trampling under foot all rules of
judicial procedure and the clearest principles of justice,
he brought to the scaffold one after another of the proudest
nobles of France, by sentences dictated by himself
to extraordinary judges of his own selection; thus teaching
the doctrine of social equality by lessons too impressive
to be misinterpreted or forgotten by any later generation.
Both the privileges, in exchange for which the
greater fiefs had exchanged their independence, and the
franchises, the conquest of which the cities, in earlier
times, had successfully contended, were alike swept
away by this remorseless innovator. He exiled the mother,
oppressed the wife, degraded the brother, banished
the confessor, and put to death the kinsmen and favorites
of the king, and compelled the king himself to be the instrument
of these domestic severities. Though surrounded
by enemies and by rivals, his power ended only
with his life. Though beset by assassins, he died in the
ordinary course of nature. Though he had waded to
dominion through slaughter, cruelty and wrong, he
passed to his great account amid the applause of the
people and the benedictions of the church; and, as far as
any human eye could see, in hope, in tranquillity and in
peace. What, then, is the reason why so tumultuous a
career reached at length so serene a close? The reason
is, that amid all his conflicts Richelieu wisely and successfully
maintained three powerful alliances. He cultivated
the attachment of men of letters, the favor of the
commons, and the sympathy of all French idolaters of
the national glory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In some admirable lectures on the Power of the Pen
in France, Stephen gives fine portraits of Rabelais, Montaigne,
Calvin and Pascal. One remark about Calvin
struck us as especially felicitous. Speaking of him as
writing his great work in Geneva, he says—“The beautiful
lake of that city, and the mountains which encircle
it, lay before his eyes as he wrote; but they are said to
have suggested to his fancy no images, and to have drawn
from his pen not so much as one transient allusion.
With his mental vision ever directed to that melancholy
view of the state and prospects of our race which he
had discovered in the Book of Life, it would, indeed,
have been incongruous to have turned aside to depict
any of those glorious aspects of the creative benignity
which were spread around him in the Book of Nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most valuable chapters in the volume are perhaps
those which relate to the character and government of
Louis XIV. The absolute monarchy established by him
is thoroughly analyzed. Among many curious illustrations
of that tyranny and perfidy which this great
master of king-craft systematized into a science, Stephen
translates from his “Memoires Historiques” a
series of maxims, addressed to the Dauphin, for his
guidance whenever he should be called upon to wear the
crown of France. Louis’s celebrated aphorism, “I am
the state,” is in these precious morsels of absolutism
expanded into a rule of conduct. We quote a few of
them, as, to republican ears, they may have the effect of
witticisms:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the will of Heaven, who has given kings to
man, that they should be revered as his vice-regents, he
having reserved to himself alone the right to scrutinize
their conduct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the will of God that every subject should yield
to his sovereign on implicit obedience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The worst calamity which can befall any one of our
rank is to be reduced to that subjection, in which the
monarch is obliged to receive the law from his people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the essential vice of the English monarchy that
the king can make no extraordinary levies of men or
money without the consent of the Parliament, nor
convene the Parliament without impairing his own authority.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All property within our realm belongs to us in virtue
of the same title. The funds actually deposited in our
treasury, the funds in the hands of the revenue officers,
<span class='it'>and the funds which we allow our people to employ in
their various occupations</span>, are all <span class='it'>equally</span> subject to our
control.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be assured that kings are absolute lords, who may
fitly and freely dispose of all property in the possession
either of churchmen or of laymen, though they are bound
always to employ it as faithful stewards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since the lives of his subjects belong to the prince,
he is obliged to be solicitous for the preservation of
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first basis of all other reforms was the rendering
my own will properly absolute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of his remarks on treaties, from the same volume,
convey a fair impression of the king’s good faith
to his allies. All mankind knows that he was in conduct
a measureless liar and trickster, and that no treaty
could hold him; but it is not perhaps generally known
that he generalized perfidy into a principle, and had no
conception that in so doing he was violating any moral
or religious duty. He thus solemnly instructs the
dauphin—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In dispensing with the exact observance of treaties,
we do not violate them; for the language of such instruments
is not to be understood literally. We must employ
in our treaties a conventional phraseology, just as
we use complimentary expressions in society. They
are indispensable in our intercourse with one another,
but they always mean much less than they say. The
more unusual, circumspect and reiterated were the
clauses by which the Spaniards excluded me from assisting
Portugal, the more evident it is that the Spaniards
did not believe that I should really withhold such assistance.”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Podesta’s Daughter, and other Miscellaneous Poems.
By George H. Boker. Author of “Calaynos,” “Anne
Boleyn,” “The Betrothal,” etc. Philadelphia: A.
Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Boker is ever a welcome visitant among the regions
of literature. The present volume is understood
to be composed of those lighter efforts of his muse which
have engaged his attention at intervals between the composition
of his larger works, “Calaynos,” “Anne Boleyn”
and “The Betrothal.” Some of these minor
poems have already seen the light, under the auspices of
our leading magazines; but by far the greater part of the
book is fresh, and all of it bears evidence of that genuine
inspiration, and that high finish, without which the author
never appears before the reading public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Podesta’s Daughter” is an Italian tale or legend,
thrown into that dramatic form for which Mr. Boker has
shown such a remarkable gift. The story is very briefly
this. A lowly maiden is loved and wooed by one far
above her in life, a son of the neighboring duke. The
father and brother of the maid, believing the high-born
youth to be merely selfish and insidious in his offers of
love and marriage, seek to rescue her from what appears
to them a fatal snare, and persuade her to reject his addresses
and even pretend to be affianced to another, a
country hind in her own walk in life. The young and
uncalculating noble, stung to the quick by her apparent
preference of a rival so utterly unworthy of him and of
her, suddenly abandoned his home and castle, and engaged
during all the prime and meridian of his days in
distant foreign wars. In the evening of life he returns,
alone and almost a stranger, to the scenes of his youth.
On approaching his castle, he falls in with an old man,
the “Podesta,” by whom he is not recognized. In the
dialogue between them, the Podesta, being questioned
by the apparent stranger, tells the story of himself and
family, and especially of his “daughter,” by whose
untimely grave they are standing. She died of a broken
heart, after the abrupt departure of the young duke,
years ago. It is the old story. True love, not left to
its native instincts, but thwarted and driven devious by
the manœuvres of the suspicious. Though Italian in
manners, and dramatic in form, it is a true story of the
heart. It is told with infinite skill, and must win for its
author a bright addition to the chaplet which already
surrounds his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first scene in the “Podesta’s Daughter,” is a
good instance of the quiet ease with which Mr. Boker
makes an actor bring out the points of a story, so that
the reader is at once posted up to the very moment of
action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manner in which the intimacy began between the
young count and the Podesta’s daughter, Giulia, is described
in a passage remarkable equally for its simplicity
and its beauty. It is a good specimen also of the author’s
power of nicely discriminating character.</p>

<div class='dramastart'><!----></div>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Count Odo—mark the contrast—so we called,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Through ancient courtesy, the old duke’s son—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Came from the Roman breed of Italy.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A hundred Cæsars poured their royal blood</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Through his full veins. He was both flint and fire;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Haughty and headlong, shy, imperious,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Tender, disdainful, tearful, full of frowns—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Cold as the ice on Ætna’s wintry brow,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And hotter than its flame. All these by turns.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A mystery to his tutors and to me—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Yet some have said his father fathomed him—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A mystery to my daughter, but a charm</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Deeper than magic. Him my daughter loved.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My functions drew me to the castle oft,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thither sometimes my daughter went with me;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And I have noticed how young Odo’s eyes</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Would light her up the stairway, lead her on</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From room to room, through hall and corridor,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Showing her wonders, which were stale to him,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With a new strangeness: for familiar things,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beneath her eyes, grew glorified to him,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And woke a strain of boyish eloquence,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dressed with high thoughts and fluent images,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That sometimes made him wonder at himself,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who had been blind so long to every charm</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Which her admiring fancy gave his home.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Oft I have caught them standing rapt before</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Some barbarous portrait, grim with early art—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A Gorgon, to a nicely balanced eye,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That scarcely hinted at humanity;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Yet they would crown it with the port of Jove,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Make every wrinkle a heroic scar,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And light that garbage of forgotten times</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With such a legendary halo, as would add</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Another lustre to the Golden Book.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>At first the children pleased me; many a laugh,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That reddened them, I owed their young romance.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But the time sped, and Giulia ripened too,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Yet would not deem herself the less a child:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And when I clad me for the castle, she</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Would deck herself in the most childish gear,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And lay her hand in mine, and tranquilly</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Look for the kindness in my eyes. She called</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Odo her playfellow—“The little boy who showed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The pictures and the blazoned hooks,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The glittering armor and the oaken screen,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Grotesque with wry-faced purgatorial shapes</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Twisted through all its leaves and knotted vines;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the grand, solemn window, rich with forms</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of showy saints in holyday array</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of green, gold, red, orange and violet,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With the pale Christ who towered above them all</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dropping a ruby splendor from his side.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She told how “Odo—silly child! would try</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To catch the window’s glare upon her neck,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or her round arms,” and how “the flatterer vowed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The gleam upon her temple seemed to pale</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beside the native color of her cheek.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Prattle like this enticed me to her wish,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Though cooler reason shook his threatening hand,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And counseled flat denial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this retired fountain the spirits enter into a discussion

its inhabitants at once to perdition. But the third spirit,
a superior intelligence,</p>

<p class='pindent'>This superior angel maintains that man, though not
capable of instantaneous acts or intuitive perceptions,
equal to those of the higher orders of beings, is yet not
the mere hopeless castaway the two other spirits would
make him. Give him but time, and with pain and toil
he will work out results worthy even of an angel’s regard.
An angel, by direct intuition, may see at once in
a shapeless lump of matter all the forms of beauty of
which it is capable. Yet man, in process of time, slowly
but surely, can bring forth those same wonderful forms.

<p class='pindent'>The prologue, which thus introduces us to the studio
of the “Ivory Carver,” may be deemed by some far-fetched
and metaphysical. To us it seems a most beautiful
preparation for what follows. It attunes the mind
to a just appreciation of that self-sacrificing devotion
with which the artist, year by year, in silence, in want,
toils away to work out of the solid ivory the divine
thought which haunts him. The moral of the prologue,
as we understand it, is to connect the inspirations of
genius with their true source. It prepares us to look at
the toiling “ivory carver,” not as he appeared to his
family and neighbors, a madman or a fool, but as he
might have appeared to some celestial visitant, who
knew the secrets of his heaven-touched soul.</p>

<div class='dramastart'><!----></div>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Silently sat the artist alone,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Carving a Christ from the ivory bone.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Little by little, with toil and pain,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He won his way through the sightless grain,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That held and yet hid the thing he sought,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Till the work stood up, a growing thought.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And all around him, unseen yet felt,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A mystic presence forever dwelt,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A formless spirit of subtle flame,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The light of whose being went and came</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As the artist paused from work, or bent</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His whole heart to it with firm intent.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Husband, why sit you ever alone,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Carving your Christ from the ivory bone?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>O, carve, I pray you, some fairy ships,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or rings for the weaning infant’s lips,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or toys for yon princely boy who stands</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Knee-deep in the bloom of his father’s lands.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And waits for his idle thoughts to come;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or carve the sword hilt, or merry drum,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or the flaring edge of a curious can,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Fit for the lips of a bearded man:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With vines and grapes in a cunning wreath,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where the peering satyrs wink beneath,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And catch around quaintly knotted stems</p>
<p class='dramaline'>At flying nymphs by their garment hems.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>O carve you something of solid worth—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Leave heaven to heaven, come, earth to earth.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Carve that thy hearth-stone may glimmer bright,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And thy children laugh in dancing light.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Steadily answered the carver’s lips,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As he brushed from his brow the ivory chips;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>While the presence grew with the rising sound,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Spurning in grandeur the hollow ground,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As if the breath on the carver’s tongue</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Were fumes from some precious censer swung,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That lifted the spirit’s winged soul</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To the heights where crystal planets roll</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their choral anthems, and heaven’s wide arch</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Is thrilled with the music of their march;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the faithless shades flew backward, dim</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From the wondrous light that lived in him—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thus spake the carver—his words were few,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Simple and meek, but he felt them true—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“I labor by day, I labor by night,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The Master ordered, the work is right:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Pray that He strengthen my feeble good;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For much must be conquered, much withstood.”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The artist labored, the labor sped,</p>

of Mr. Boker’s that we see furnishes additional
evidence of his true calling as a poet. Should he never
write another line, he has already, in the brief space of
three years, done enough to make his name classical.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a revised edition of a book which attracted, at
the time it originally appeared, a great deal of attention
from an intelligent but limited class of readers. We
trust that it will have a more extended circulation now
that it is in the hands of an enterprising publishing

and best of Mr. Judd’s works, and though it exhibits
the ingrained defects of the author’s genius, it has freshness,
originality and raciness enough to more than compensate
for its occasional provoking defiance of taste and
obedience to whim. The sketches of character are bold,
true, powerful and life-like; the descriptions of New
England scenery eminently vivid and clear; and an exquisite
sense of moral beauty is accompanied by a sense
no less genial and subtle for the humorous in life, character
and manners. It is perhaps as thoroughly American
as any romance in our literature.</p>

Maps and Illustrations. By E. G. Squier, late Chargé
D’Affaires of the United States to the Republics of Central
America. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. 2 vols.
8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is perhaps the most valuable book of travels
which any American has contributed to literature since
Stephens relinquished his pen; and, if we may believe
Mr. Squier, his subject-matter is of the greatest importance
to every patriot. According to him, the future
eminence of our country depends on the policy which
the United States now adopts in regard to the affairs of
Central America; and his visions of the material prosperity
which will result from the bold, firm and intelligent
action of our government in the matter, are gorgeous
as Sir Epicure Mammon’s. And it must be admitted
that he sustains his positions by facts and arguments
which every American should be familiar with, and
which cannot be obtained any where in a more compact
form than in Mr. Squier’s own work, which contains a
complete geographical and topographical account of
Nicaragua, and of the other States of Central America,
with observations on their climate, agriculture and mineral
productions and general resources; a narrative of his
own residence in Nicaragua, giving the results of his
personal explorations of its aboriginal monuments, and
his observations on its scenery and people; notes on the
aborigines of the country, with such full information
regarding “their geographical distributions and relations,
languages, institutions, customs and religion, as
shall serve to define their ethnical position in respect to
the other semi-civilized aboriginal nations of this continent;”
an outline of the political history of Central
America since it threw off the dominion of Spain, and
above all, a very elaborate view of the geography and
topography of Nicaragua, as connected with the proposed
interoceanic canal. Mr. Squier writes on all
these subjects from personal knowledge and investigation,
and with the freshness and power of a man who
has got all his information at first hand. The work is
profusely illustrated with appropriate engravings from
drawings made on the spot, and is also well supplied
with accurate maps. Bating some redundancies of style
proceeding from a mania for fine writing, these volumes
are, from their intrinsic and permanent value, worthy
of more general attention than almost any work of the

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Wesley and Methodism. By Isaac Taylor. New York:
Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 12 mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this valuable and thoughtful volume is
extensively known both in England and the United
States as a philosophic writer on the great themes and
great exponents of Christian faith. As in a former
volume he considered Jesuitism in Loyola, its founder,
so in this he views Methodism in Wesley. His penetrative
and meditative mind, equally acute and sympathetic,
readily discovers the connection between
opinions and character, principles and persons; and by
viewing sects and systems psychologically and historically
in the characters and lives of their founders, he
gives the interest of biography to the discussion of the
most metaphysical questions of theology. His present
work is eminently original and suggestive, evincing on
every page the movement of a deep and earnest nature,
and an intellect at once critical and interpretative. His
own religious nature is too profound to allow his indulgence
in any of those phrases of sarcasm, contempt, or
pity, which it used to be fashionable to speak of Methodism
and Methodists; but though he considers the religious
movement which he analyses and represents as a genuine
development of the principal elements of Christianity,
and as second only to the Reformation in importance
among the providential modes of vitalizing and diffusing
the faith, he is still calm, reasonable and austerely just
in his judgments. His criticism of the prominent Methodists
is an example. He sees clearly that they were not
great men mentally. “Let it be confessed,” he says,
“that this company does not include one mind of that
amplitude and grandeur, the contemplation of which, as
a natural object—a sample of humanity—excites a pleasurable
awe, and swells the bosom with a vague ambition,
or with a noble emulation. Not one of the founders
of Methodism can claim to stand on any such high
level; nor was one of them gifted with the philosophic
faculty—the abstractive and analytic power. More than
one was a shrewd and exact logician, but none a master
of the higher reason. Not one was erudite in more than
an ordinary degree; not one was an accomplished
scholar; yet while several were fairly learned, few
were illiterate, and none showed themselves to be imbued
with the fanaticism of ignorance.” In his sketches
of Charles Wesley, Whitfield, Fletcher, Coke, and Lady
Huntingdon, we have the truth given of those remarkable
persons, unmixed with the exaggeration either of
admiration or contempt. The volume as a whole, is
the most comprehensive and accurate work on Methodism
which we have ever seen.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume is a truly original book of travels, not so
much because it describes new scenes, but because it
describes them from a different point of view. It consists
of letters written by three boys, whose respective
ages are twelve, fourteen and sixteen, traveling in Europe
under the care of their instructor, the Rev. Dr.
Choules. Quick to see and eager to enjoy, fresh in mind
and heart, these boys seem to write because they have
much to say, and because their heads are so full of enchanting
objects that a discharge of ink is absolutely
necessary to preserve them from mental apoplexy. And
we must admit that they have made a book which in
interest, raciness and in the power of communicating
their own delight to the reader, fairly excels many a
volume of more pretension. The presiding spirit of the
whole correspondence is, of course, the kindly and accomplished
editor, a person who combines in an extraordinary
degree, the joyous and elastic soul of youth
with the large knowledge and experience of manhood.
His own letters in the volume are very characteristic
epistles, and add much to its value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The authors of this American romance have produced
a literary curiosity—a volume, every page of which is
the product of two minds, without any apparent jarring
of style or sentiment. In the conduct of the story, it is
true, a little uncertainty is visible, but that appears to
arise as much from the nature of the plot as from the
presence of two hands in moving it forward. It is well
written, has some capital descriptions of scenery and
some very exciting incidents, and, in idea and sentiment,
is a combination of English and American modes of
thought and feeling. The scene in the Medical College
is the most powerful in the volume.</p>

Chalmers’ life, between 1824 and 1835, when some of his
most important works were written, and when his
communications with men eminent in politics and letters
were most frequent. Brougham, Peel, Melbourne,
Mackintosh, Irving, Coleridge, and many other celebrities,

<p class='pindent'>America has but one recognizable stamp of nobility.
No line of descent in the blood of kings, can ennoble here.
The stagnant pool which has lost its vitality for ages in

<span class='it'>Energy</span>—<span class='it'>Will</span>—nobly directed—that quality which
Kossuth proclaims to be the conqueror of impossibilities.
It is this quality, largely possessed by the Anglo-Saxon,
and the free field open for its exercise in America, that
have made her what she is—</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the noble hopes and manly aspirations in the
breast of her sons—the far-reaching, the attainable grasp
of future fortune, the birth-right of the humblest—the
unconquerable purpose to do, to achieve, to conquer, that
exalt us to “giants in these days.” We have the highest
manifestation of manhood, in a fair field, with <span class='it'>all</span> the
favor that God grants to mortals to carve out their own
destinies. He who sinks here, goes down with supineness,
slothfulness, idleness, and their attendant vices
clinging to his neck with more than mill-stone weight.
With high health and a perfect use of his faculties, no
man <span class='it'>here</span> has a right to be ignoble. “The longer I live,”
says Goethe, “the more certain I am that the great
difference between men, the great and significant, is
energy—invincible determination—an honest purpose

who walk the Quarter-Deck of Uncle Sam’s 74’s.</p>

<hr class='tbk153'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Reader</span>—“Graham” makes his best bow to you in
this number, and stands, cap in hand, waiting a friendly
return to his salutation. He has prepared himself with
some care for this call, and if you do not like his rig,
don’t turn up your nose disdainfully, but suggest any
proper alteration in his costume, and when he comes
again you may like him better. The critics! Well!
who cares for the critics? Not Graham! He is a critic
himself, and can carve you a poet to a nicety—slicing off
his wings with one sweep of his steel. But Graham is
tender to poets—for they are a good-hearted race, albeit
a little irritable—apt to be dealt unjustly with, too, considering
that each one is imbued with more than a Shaksperian
genius, and people wont believe it. It is
enough to make anybody mad—and a mad poet is of
all enraged animals the most vehemently disposed to
slaughter somebody. So, having disposed in brief of
critics and poets, and of lawyers and briefs in the body
of the work, we feel heavenly-minded toward the rest
of creation—and in this mood we turn to “<span class='it'>the gentlemen
of the press</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If our exchanges believe <span class='it'>all</span> that is told them by
some of the Magazine publishers, they will soon begin
to fancy that “the moon <span class='it'>is</span> a green cheese,” and will
wake up some fine night finding themselves cutting
slices for an imaginary breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One chap has the audacity to set himself up as the
<span class='it'>sole</span> patron of American arts and letters, and has spent
<span class='it'>unheard</span> of amounts on artists and writers. We fear to
inquire into this business <span class='it'>too</span> closely, lest it should turn
out like the charity of the lady who was “collecting for a
poor woman.” It <span class='it'>was</span> charity—for it “began at home,”
and <span class='it'>ended there</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now “Graham” you may rely upon—there is a certain
don’t care for anybody air about <span class='it'>him</span> that you can
understand. If any fellow wishes to blow up his Magazine,
Graham asks him—nay, commands him to “blaze
away”—if he don’t like the painted fashions, which cost
$945, lo! Graham goes to the enormous expense of $2
and gives him his “own peculiar” in wood—Bloomer and
all, fresh from the newspapers, and not credited to Paris
either—if the small-talk don’t suit—Graham suggests
something else, and invites him to read some of the
other Magazines, where the editor “talks big,” and
swells in imaginary dignity until a turkey is rather cast
into the shade by overblown dignity—if he don’t like
the stories he may read the essays—if neither, the poetry
is before him—and if literature has no charms for him,
he may admire Art in the engravings: “if none of these
things move him,” let him admire Nature by looking at
himself in a mirror, and imagine his ears wonderfully
grown, and his voice a lion’s. Graham is as easily
pleased as a young girl at her first ball, and thinks the
world is moving round to the timing of music—and
though he is as poor as Job’s—ah! that reminds us of
<span class='it'>the turkeys</span> we sent to editors.</p>

<hr class='tbk154'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Turkey Ovation.</span>—Never, we suppose, since
the day the Romans overran the world, has there been
such terrible bloodshed and sanguinary goings on, as
was consequent upon Graham’s royal edict about Turkey.
The crimson <a id='die'></a>dye was streaming about all the
editorial sanctums on Christmas Eve. Graham had
issued orders to bring up the culprits for execution, and
at about ten o’clock, at <span class='it'>a given</span> signal, twelve hundred
of the inhabitants of Turkeydom were marched out, and
had their throats cut without mercy. The bloody-minded
issuer of this sanguinary decree still lives and
glories in the deed; and strange to say—his men back him
up with fixed bayonets. If these things are allowed to
proceed, people will not be able to sleep quietly in their
beds, but a terror will go forth over the land, and neighbors
will have to keep watch and ward over each other—turkeys
will be, <span class='it'>nowhere</span>—editors will grow fat, on
the fat of the land, and will soon have the hardihood to
ask their subscribers to pay for the papers they read,
with the same promptitude with which they expect
them delivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sort of thing will go on. A revolution in newspaper
presses will be the consequence, and quiet, sedate
people, who read over the paper, and complain of the
type—of the quality of the paper—of the long editorials—of
the short editorials—of the light reading—of the
heavy reading—of the political matter—of the want of
political news and facts—of the poetry—of the advertisements—of
the mails—of the carrier—of the publisher, the
editor, and the “devil”—will be shocked at having a
<span class='it'>bill</span> to pay. Turkey must be paid for, as well as
slaughtered. There is no community of goods in Turkey.
Every landholder expects the pay for corn that feeds
and fattens turkey—and subscribers must expect to—“<span style='font-size:smaller'>PAY
UP</span>.” Graham will get the blame—but the revolution
<span class='it'>will</span> go on! People who grumble—and, some of
them—swear! about their papers, must <span class='it'>pay for the
luxury</span>. No man has a right to <span class='it'>be stupid</span>—nor can expect
editors to eat turkeys and publish newspapers
on air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We thought so. Well, take Graham’s advice, and
take $2, ‘pay up,’ and take a receipt at once. You have
no idea how it will clear your conscience, and your
eye-sight, too, as to the <span class='it'>merits</span> of the paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Snow-Balling in the South.</span>—Our Southern friends
seem to have been taken by surprise by Jack Frost, and
to have had some difficulty in acknowledging his acquaintance.
At New Orleans we see, that Sambo was
out early in the morning, and came rushing back to his
master exclaiming—“<span class='it'>Oh, Monsieur! regardez donc! la
cour est pleine de sucre blanc!</span>” “Oh, sir, look: the yard
is full of <span class='it'>white sugar</span>!” “The oldest inhabitants,” says
the Delta, “stared with amazement. It snowed all
night, and in the morning the earth was entirely invisible;
a white carpet, to the depth of eight inches, covered
its entire surface. Our population were all agog, and
snow-balls flew as thick and as fast as bullets at Buena
Vista. The hats of peaceable citizens were knocked into
corners; eyes and mouths were filled with conglomerated
masses of snow, and ears were stopped.” In
Florida, according to the News, “There was no record
nor tradition of such an event in the history of East
Florida. Some of the oldest inhabitants recollect, on
one or two occasions, having seen a slight sprinkle of
snow, but not enough to whiten the ground, and it passed
off like a dream. But on this occasion we had an opportunity
of enjoying the delightful amusement of “snow-balling;”
and ladies, as fair as the snow itself, joined
heartily in an amusement, the opportunity for which
presents itself only once in a century.” Mrs. Neal, in
her very sprightly and delightful letters from Charleston,
S. C., gives an animated picture of the scene in
Palmettodom: “Even in Philadelphia, where snow is
by no means an every day affair, you cannot credit the
excitement it gave rise to. The children, many of whom
had never seen ‘the white rain,’ clapped their hands as
the roofs and the ground were covered with the pure
mantle—and when evening came, and the strange visitor
seemed to like its Southern quarters, and resolved to
settle for the night, men and boys went forth to the novel
enjoyment of snow-balling, and some even attempted a
sleigh-ride. Grave, grown up men were startled into
an involuntary participation of the sport, and I was told,
and it is <span class='it'>too good a story not to be true</span>, that one gentleman
was seen indulging in the unusual pastime accompanied
by a negro carrying his ‘spare balls’—all ready
moulded in a box! Snow-balling under circumstances
of ‘elegant leisure.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next morning’s sun seemed to have little effect upon
it, the cold still continuing intense; and about the middle
of the day a party, a regular duel it seemed, ascended
to the top of the Charleston hotel and the Hague street
stores, pelting each other with great vigor, the plazza
upon which we stood affording a fine view of the sport.
The children were for the first time indulged with snow-building,
and many a youthful Powers made his first effort
at sculpture on the frozen countenance of a ‘snow-man.’
It was more curious still that they considered it in the
light of a confection, and ate it with salt, as they would
a hard boiled egg, esteeming it much nicer than any
candy. ‘It was fun to them—but death to the servants’—to
borrow from the fable of the boys and the frogs.
The poor negroes, wilted and shriveled up into ‘dumb
waiters’—burning over the fire, with a deprecating
glance at the snow covered ground that was really piteous,
but every consideration was paid to them, and
as little out-door work as possible assigned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot refrain from adding the following delicious
little bit of character-painting, from the same pen,
though not <span class='it'>germaine</span> to the theme: “If there is one thing
that distinguishes the Southern negro above all others,
it is <span class='it'>deliberation</span>. We had a fair example of this the
morning of our arrival. There was not a soul on the
wharf to take the rope of the steamer which some
thoughtful person had thrown on shore without looking
to see what was to be done with it. There were the
passengers with eager, expectant faces, grouped upon
the deck, baggage already looked over, and piled up for
the carriages—every thing ready to land, and we just so
far from the shore that a plank could not be thrown
across. Presently a negro appeared on the next wharf,
walking toward us with the utmost calmness. In vain
were the calls of the Northern gentlemen in tartan
shawls, or the impatient gestures of one of the officers of
the boat. A New York wharf lounger would have had
the rope secured in the time this venerable Ned took to
put one foot before the other. And when he finally arrived
amid the cheers of the passengers, who by this time
thought it as well to laugh as fret, one of them called out
as he bent over to the rope thrown once more—‘Uncle—I
say—hadn’t you better <span class='it'>wipe</span> it first?’—a finale
which could not have been more deliberate than his previous
movements.”</p>

<hr class='tbk156'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Small.</span>—There <span class='it'>is</span> something smaller in the world than
Graham’s small-talk, and that is, a soul in a pill-box.
We know several that are just in that way imprisoned—and
they belong to fellows who are afraid
to notice a rival publication, for <span class='it'>fear</span> people will believe

<p class='pindent'>“We would not do without this Magazine for treble
its price; and as we consider ourself as having some
taste in this matter, we warmly recommend Graham to
the lovers of chaste and classical literature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our friend of the Picayune will be glad to know that
there are 30,000 people of his mind, who cling to Graham
always. Then, there is a “floating population” of
20,000 more, who don’t know their own minds, but shift
about to all points of the compass and come back again
to Graham, grumbling at others, when the fault is their
own for having left Graham at all. These wanderers
are coming in, in flocks, for ’52, but we don’t <span class='it'>count</span> on

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A Leap Year Love Letter</span>.—We have received a
very delightful leap year love letter from a <span class='it'>very</span> beautiful
young lady living in Maine—we wont tell in what
post-town—but we know she is beautiful from the very
elegant epistle she writes, and that she is a lady of discernment
from the very handsome things she says of
“Graham”—and that she is <span class='it'>smart</span> from the very way
she edges in her proposal to be our second in case we
are married already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are happy to say that we are a Benedict, and as
Kossuth has prudently introduced no Turkish notions into
his addresses to the ladies, we have great doubts about
indulging in any dreams as to “pluralities.” But still,
we may safely say, as we do “by permission,” that the
young lady who sends “Graham” the largest club for
1852, shall receive the favor of our most distinguished
consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Graham” may now be considered in the market for
“proposals,” and if all the handsome things the press
say of him are read and pondered over—as they ought to
be—he will receive a perfect shower of adoration in the
agreeable form of attached and worshiping subscribers.
“Graham” holds the King of <span class='it'>clubs</span> and Knave of <span class='it'>hearts</span>,
now—so every young lady knows the lead.</p>

<hr class='tbk160'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Advertising.</span>—Business is business and must be
<span class='it'>pressed</span> home. Now we have a business secret for your
ear, reader! one which we charge you nothing for; but
which comes charged with weighty and important meaning.
<span class='it'>Do you ever advertise?</span> No! Why there is nothing
like advertising to make a fortune! Nearly all
the men about here, who never advertised, have <span class='it'>taken in</span>
their signs, shut up shop, been taken in themselves and
have gone to California—the dupes of the very advertising
in the newspapers, which they scorned while fortune
was all around them. You must take hold of this
lever that moves the business world. Advertise in <span class='it'>your
local papers</span>—if your business is local—let your neighbors
know that you have something to <span class='it'>sell</span>—that you
wish to <span class='it'>buy</span> something—or, that you are ready to <span class='it'>trade</span>.
Wake up! and wake up your neighbors! We should
never be able to publish Graham with 112 pages per
month, if we did not let the world <span class='it'>know</span> that we are
wide awake, and ready to supply any quantity of numbers
for 1852, <span class='it'>having stereotyped the book purposely</span>.
Now, drowsy head! do <span class='it'>you</span> suppose that if you are a
storekeeper you would not sell more goods by advertising?
Or if a mechanic, that it will do you any harm
to be known far and near as an active, enterprising business
man ready for customers? Or, if a farmer, with a lot
of <span class='it'>extra</span> corn or potatoes to sell, that you could not <span class='it'>make</span>
a market? Do you suppose, that you can put your
hands into your pockets and whistle a fortune into
them, too? If you do, advertise <span class='it'>that</span>, and be immortal.</p>

<hr class='tbk161'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Our Stories.</span>—We have adopted the plan of giving
our readers one long story complete, in each number—say
from twelve to twenty pages. In the January number
we gave “The Rich Man’s Whims,” which was
universally praised by the press and by the readers of
this Magazine. “Anna Temple,” which appeared in the
February number, we think, was a better story, and so
say many critics competent to judge. “The Democrat,”
at Ballston, N. Y., says, in noticing the last number—“Graham
now contains, and will continue to contain,
during this year, more reading matter monthly than any
similar work published in the country. The story,
“Anna Temple,” in the February number, is one of the
finest tales we have ever read, and is alone worth more
than the year’s subscription to the Magazine.” And
this is but one, of scores of such notices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the present number our readers will find a <span class='it'>gem</span>
called “The Miser and His Daughter,” written by a
gentleman of New Orleans—the author of the story
of “The Little Family,” which appeared in the November
number of “Graham”—a tale which was more
widely read and praised than any article in the last volume.
We have received the first part of an article by
this writer, which we shall give in future numbers, and
we do not hesitate to say, for the benefit of those who
worship British ability <span class='it'>only</span>, that no article <span class='it'>equal</span> to it
has appeared in Blackwood or Frazer for years. It is
called “The First Age.”</p>

<hr class='tbk162'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Caution.</span>—“My goodness,” says a cautious and
gouty old gentleman, who is one of Graham’s friends,
“aint you afraid to talk at your subscribers and exchanges
the way you do?” <span class='it'>No!</span> not a bit of it—Graham
will tell “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth,” to every body who reads his editorial
chit-chat. If people don’t like it, they need not read it.
In 112 pages there is room and verge enough to dodge
around sharp corners and escape the dilemma of reading
the few pages in which Graham, kicking off his boots,
goes at people with his slippers on. Every body, in
1852, will get <span class='it'>more</span> than a full return for what is paid
for the book, without counting “The Small-Talk”—and
if any editor don’t like it, let him let it alone. “The
whole boundless continent is <span class='it'>not</span> ours,” but the small-talk
<span class='it'>is</span>—and being monarch sole and absolute in these
dominions, we shall submit to no impertinence, but <span class='it'>will</span>
have our own will and way—and the way is straight and
plain. We do not expect to get a decent notice from the
Saturday Evening Post, for all this—and we don’t care
if we don’t—nor if we do.</p>

<hr class='tbk163'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Graham on Dreams.</span>—Did you ever dream you were
rich? Is it not delightful!—while it lasts. A prize in
the lottery—dreaming of numbers innumerable, is one of
the tricks of Morpheus—and of people wide awake, too,
sometimes. Then the visions of defunct grand-uncles,
beyond the seas, who hearing of our great worth and deservings,
die on purpose to make us happy, and bequeath
vast estates and lots of three per cents. in the <span class='it'>funds</span>. It
is glorious! And then, too, ponderous mails coming
to you, in which each subscriber, who is in debt, sends
you the money—and dozens—dozens?—hats full, of letters
inclosing the long delayed $3, come like blessings in
troops—the notes all new, too, and 6’s instead of 3’s sent
by the overjoyed subscriber—not in a mistake either—for
he <span class='it'>says</span> “the work is worth double the money, and
being an honest man, I intend to pay the fair value.”
Ah! this is grand! We like to do business with people
who know something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>John</span>, <span class='sc'>John</span>!—Call Mr. Graham, and tell him the
printer wants copy—<span class='it'>and paper too</span>!” Pshaw!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look here! We hate to be deceived. Somebody
make our “dream come true.”</p>

<hr class='tbk164'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Fine Ink.</span>—We take pleasure in calling the attention
of printers to the very superior quality of the ink used in
the printing of our wood-cut forms. It is from the establishment
of Messrs. Romig, Lay &amp; Co., 51 South
Fourth street, Philadelphia. They are prepared to furnish
different qualities at various prices to the trade.
Letters addressed to them will be promptly attended to.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Dollar Newspaper</span>, which is edited by a
Sailor, who has been to Egypt—you see—and a long
Lane—who has denied the proverb, and done us a good
“turn,” has sent us a spanking club by Hudley, its ever
attentive and active clerk. The Dollar is a great paper—worth
any day more than its silver namesake—which <span class='it'>goes</span>
now at about 102½—but where it goes <span class='it'>to</span>, puzzles the
bankers. The Newspaper has the advantage in this, for
nobody knows where it <span class='it'>don’t</span> go. In all of the 17,000
post-towns in which Graham is loved and cherished, we
find our young and vigorous brother. Graham and the
lively Dollar, are the pride of good printers and pretty
girls. Intellect, and Beauty, and Dollars and Graham’s!—what
a consummation!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth is, Graham’s modesty is sorely tried just
now, when a shout is going up from every town and
hamlet of the country on his behalf; and were it not that
the subscriptions usually keep pace with the praise, he
would not be able to exist at all.</p>

<hr class='tbk165'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Saucy and True.</span>—We shall exchange next year
with no fellow who notices “Graham” in the same line
with another work and says, he “<span class='it'>don’t know which is
the best</span>.” If a man has not courage enough to say that
Graham is the worst, or the best, or the equal of any
other magazine, as the <span class='it'>fact</span> may be, we don’t want his
company. So boys, if you like the conditions, observe
them. We <span class='it'>ask</span> no man to publish our prospectus—but
we do ask that “Graham” shall not be bundled in with
any body who happens to be traveling the same road at
the same time—as there are a good many shabby looking
fellows about whose room is better than their company—at
any rate their room shan’t be ours—that’s plump.</p>

<hr class='tbk166'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Saturday Courier</span> has been—or is, at this writing—publishing
a most powerful story called <span class='it'>Marcus Warland</span>,
from the pen of its old and valued correspondent,
Caroline Lee Hentz. The stories purchased and selected
by Mr. McMakin evince a fine taste and just discrimination,
and we often wonder where he lays his
hands upon them. The secret is partly disclosed by an
announcement in his paper that “Mrs. Hentz refused
the sum of $400 offered her by a New York bookseller,”
for the story of Marcus Warland. The new volume of
the Courier commences in March; and looking over the
storehouse of good things McMakin has, for his readers,
we say they are to be envied for ’52.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Winchester (Tenn.) Independent</span> of the 16th January,
comes to us with its head all topsy turvy, as if the
editor had been on a batter. <span class='it'>Wigg’s</span> is the publisher,
and of course has a right to ship his scalp occasionally—but
we don’t believe that the name of his town is spelt as
follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Essex Freeman</span> is a good paper, but has in its
advertising columns some “shocking bad” wood-cuts.
The editor says “American wood-engravings are apt to
be bad,” but admits an exception in favor of Devereux’s
fine pictures in our February number. Porter
and Streeter are funny dogs, but can’t <span class='it'>take</span> a joke.
Wonder what <span class='it'>ails</span> Porter!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Central New Yorker</span>, came to us with a new

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Knickerbocker.</span>—Our <span class='it'>old</span> friend Clark, the
very prince of genial natures and royal good fellows,
disdains to talk any longer, solely, to the dull and heavy
folks of “Upper Tendom;” so, showing no quarters, he
comes down to “a quarter,” and pitches his tent in the
field of the many—throwing his banner to the gale, without
getting upon one himself. If Clark does not print
and <span class='it'>sell</span> 50,000 copies “the fools are <span class='it'>not</span> all dead,” but
maintain a very decided majority among the “peoples.”
If any body wishes “Old Knick” and young Graham
together, they can accomplish their benevolent desire
by sending us $5. “The Old Gentleman” and the
Young ’un are celebrities of “this enlightened nineteenth

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>The Old Colony Memorial</span>,” published at Plymouth,

Its editor, who does not like fun of any kind, has the
following satisfactory</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Conundrum.</span>—Why is Church-membership like Charity?

<p class='pindent'>Our friend of “the olden time,” Samuel C. Atkinson,

<p class='pindent'>Why, Mr. Plaindealer, the sooner you get rid of these

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Southern Literary Papers.</span>—Godman writes us
that his new Southern Literary Journal, “The Family
Friend,” is “going off like hot cakes.” We are heartily
glad of this for two reasons; First, because we like
Godman for his energy of character and his splendid
genius, which blazes out in every line he writes, pure as
a vestal lamp amid the surrounding debasement of the
minds of many writers of romance. Secondly, because
the South <span class='it'>ought</span> to maintain one or <span class='it'>more</span> first rate literary
papers, and the North should help her do it with
cordial good-will. She has been liberal, to us of the
North, in her support, for years of <span class='it'>our</span> literary magazines
and gazettes—let us <span class='it'>now</span> return the compliment
with earnestness and kindliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of Godman’s best articles have enriched and
will continue to enrich <span class='it'>our</span> pages, and as he has started
manfully, in competition with Northern periodicals,
Graham says—to his friends—<span class='it'>Stand by your banner,</span>
<span class='it'>boys!</span>—let there be a brotherhood in letters at least, and
let us leave the quarreling to ambitious politicians. So,
Godman! Graham wishes you “God speed,” and 100,000
subscribers! Any fellow who cannot respond to the
sentiment—whether he lives north or south of the Potomac—had
better button his soul in his vest pocket carefully,
or he will not be able to find it, when it is called for.</p>
